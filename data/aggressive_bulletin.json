The department offers a broad curriculum covering the major areas of the computing discipline, integrated with soft skills such as teamwork and written/oral communication; students also gain experience working on group projects. Students are exposed to the fundamentals of computing architecture and computing theory, and focus their studies on the areas of software and systems development. Faculty work directly with students to help them develop the skills and knowledge of computing professionals.\nDepartment faculty are committed to teaching excellence. They remain current in the rapidly changing field of computing technology through continuing research and publications, direct consultation with local industries, and seminar programs that bring top researchers and industry leaders to campus to speak on current developments in the field. The Supervised Industrial Research Program, Practicum option, and other mechanisms provide opportunities for graduate students to complement their academic learning with real-world experience.\nThe department has an additional commitment to sharing its knowledge and skills with the rest of the University community, with local schools, and with community-based organizations in the Bay Area.\nThe Bachelor of Science program stresses a basic foundation in mathematics and physics, and a thorough study of the fundamentals of the discipline: software development, computer architecture, operating systems, programming languages, algorithms, and the theoretical foundations of computer science. A wide variety of elective courses such as mobile development, web/internet applications, bioinformatics, database systems, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, game development, and software engineering allow students to specialize in selected areas. Ethical and social issues of computing are discussed throughout the curriculum. Senior courses include group projects to better prepare students for future job markets. Courses are updated or added regularly to provide necessary training in the latest software technologies.\nThe Master of Science in Computer Science prepares students for a wide variety of careers in computing or related industries as well as for advanced study toward Ph.D. degrees. Our program combines a solid and practical curriculum with high-quality research and project-based activities. In addition to a general core covering the breadth of the computing discipline, students may focus on software engineering in globally distributed environments, computing applications for biotechnology and the life sciences, data mining/big data, and business applications.\nOur faculty maintain active publication records, with significant funding from government agencies (NSF, NIH, Department of Labor, etc.) and industry (Genentech, Microsoft, IBM, Arista Networks, Mozilla, etc.). Students actively engage in research projects, write papers, attend conferences, and participate in funding proposals. SF State’s Center for Computing for Life Sciences and several specialized laboratories provide research and project focus, as well as opportunities to collaborate with faculty and students from other SF State departments and industry. A new Entrepreneurship Program and Developers Prize supports the development of student projects into business or non-profit ventures.\nComputing Facilities\nCentral Facilities\nA network of Mac, Linux, and PC servers supported by SF State Information Technology Services\nA Linux server (unixlab) supported by SF State Information Technology Services, used for Computer Science courses\nWorkstation labs in the SF State J.

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in Italian\nPreparation for the Major\nThe Italian major consists of 30 units of upper-division coursework. Up to 14 units of lower-division coursework or demonstrated language proficiency is required for the major.\nProficiency can be demonstrated by completing the necessary lower-division courses,\nhaving taken the equivalent coursework elsewhere,\nor testing out.\nFor advising about placement, contact the Italian program coordinator at\nalbiero@sfsu.edu.\nMost upper-division courses with the ITAL prefix are conducted in Italian, and students are expected to use Italian in their speaking, reading, and writing.\nWriting in the Major\nStudents must complete the University’s GWAR requirement by taking\nMLL 400GW\n,\nCWL 400GW\n, or\nITAL 600GW\n.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the Bachelor of Arts in Italian:\nLanguage - Students will read, listen, speak and write in Italian at an intermediate to an advanced-intermediate level.\nLinguistics - Students will identify the basic grammatical structures and elements of Italian.\nCulture - Students will be familiar with Italian historical and cultural developments in relation to an international context.\nLiterature - Students will be familiar with Italian literary production in relation to an international context.\nItalian (B.A.)\n— 30-44 units\nLower-Division Core (0-14 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nITAL 101\nFirst Semester Italian\n1\n4\nITAL 102\nSecond Semester Italian\n1\n4\nSelect Two:\n6\nITAL 103\nThird Semester Italian\n1\nITAL 104\n1\nITAL 206\nItalian Conversation\n1\nMay be fulfilled by AP test credit.\nUpper-Division Core (15 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nITAL 305\nITAL 401\nItalian Culture and Civilization\n3\nSelect One:\n3\nITAL 510\nITAL 511\nMLL 325\nLinguistics for Foreign Languages\n3\nSelect One:\n3\nCWL 400GW\nApproaches to Comparative and World Literature - GWAR\nITAL 600GW\nMLL 400GW\nReading and Analysis of Cultural Texts - GWAR\nElectives (15 units total)\nLower-Division Elective (3 units)\nOne lower-division course in Italian (e.g.,\nITAL 250\n) or a related area upon advising.\nUpper-Division Electives (12 units)\nAny upper-division course in Italian (ITAL 300+) or related area upon advising.\nNote:\nA minimum of 30 upper-division units must be completed for the degree (including upper-division units required for the major, general education, electives, etc.). A student can complete this major yet not attain the necessary number of upper-division units required for graduation. In this case, additional upper-division courses will be needed to reach the required total.\nComplementary Studies\nRequired of all candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree in Italian are 12 units of Complementary Studies, which must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ITAL, and not cross-listed with ITAL. Complementary Studies for the Italian major can be satisfied via four possible routes:\n12 units in any foreign language other than Italian (may include up to three units of MLL prefix courses);\n12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (including CSU Study Abroad and SF State Bilateral);\n12 units of coursework taken as partial completion of a second major, a minor or a certificate;\n12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an Italian Program advisor.\nRelated disciplines typically include classics, linguistics, literature, humanities, philosophy, history, music, art history, education, Jewish studies, apparel design and merchandising, industrial design, and any aspect of greater Italy, Mediterranean, Italian-American or European studies.\nWhere a course with a non-ITAL prefix, (and not cross-listed with ITAL), is taken as a core requirement or elective for the Italian major, the said course may also (double) count towards Complementary Studies only via the Study Abroad option or the second Major/Minor/Certificate option listed above. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Foreign Language option are allowed a maximum of three units of overlap of MLL-prefix courses between Italian major and Complementary Studies units. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Related Subjects option are not allowed to double-count major and Complementary Studies units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor. For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "College of Health and Social Sciences\nThe College of Health and Social Sciences was established in 1995 as the College of Health and Human Services. It is organized into the following administrative areas: Child and Adolescent Development; Family, Interiors, Nutrition & Apparel (FINA); Counseling; Criminal Justice Studies; Public Health; Kinesiology; Nursing; Physical Therapy and Clinical Laboratory Science; Recreation, Parks, and Tourism; Social Work; Sociology and Sexuality Studies; and the School of Public Affairs and Civic Engagement, which houses Environmental Studies; Gerontology; Public Administration; and Urban Studies and Planning.\nMission of the College of Health and Social Sciences\nThe College of Health and Social Sciences prepares students to help solve the most pressing and enduring issues confronting the well-being of individuals, families, communities, and society. Students, faculty, and staff participate in a learning process that fosters excellence in their professions and supports them in the pursuit of equity and social justice. To advance this mission, the College is committed to innovative teaching, scholarship, and service that inspires leadership for positive social change.\nVision of Scholarship\nConsistent with the social justice mission of the University, the hallmark of the College of Health and Social Sciences is its belief in the potential of scholarship to right a wrong - an act of intellectual advocacy to serve the public good, to wrestle with critical social problems, and to transform how individuals, communities, and institutions function – by disseminating the knowledge from basic, translational, and applied research and by advancing the practice of specific disciplines. This vision is best achieved when scholarship is supported as a faculty-initiated and faculty-driven process that emerges from their intellectual curiosity, expertise, social engagement, and professional identity. To affirm the breadth of faculty interests and to honor the spectrum of academic disciplines, the College embraces an inclusive view of scholarship as discovery, integration, application, teaching, and engagement. Among the qualities valued in scholarship, the College supports work that is ethical, innovative, interdisciplinary, collaborative, theoretical and applied.\nAccreditation\nAll of the programs subject to national accreditation are accredited:\nAccreditation\nProgram\nAgency\nPublic Administration\nNetwork of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration\nClinical Laboratory Science\nNational Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences\nCounseling\nCouncil for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs\nDietetics\nAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics\nApparel Design and Merchandising, Dietetics, Interior Design, and Family and Consumer Sciences\nAmerican Association of Family and Consumer Sciences\nNursing\nCommission on Collegiate Nursing Education and the California Board of Registered Nursing\nPhysical Therapy\nCommission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education\nPublic Health\nCouncil on Education for Public Health\nRecreation, Parks, and Tourism\nNational Recreation and Park Association\nRehabilitation Counseling\nCouncil on Rehabilitation Education\nSocial Work\nCouncil on Social Work Education\nThe Gerontology program meets the guidelines of the Association for Gerontology in Higher Education (AGHE).\nDegrees Offered\nBachelor of Arts\nChild and Adolescent Development\nConcentrations in:\nCommunity, Health, and Social Services\nEarly Care and Education – Last Admit Term Fall 2025\nElementary Education Teaching Pre-Credential\nChild Development Pre-K to 3rd Grade – Last Admit Term Fall 2025\nCriminal Justice Studies\nEarly Childhood Studies\nConcentrations in:\nCare and Education\nPK-3 Integrated Teacher Education Program\nPre-K to 3rd Grade\nSpecial Education Integrated Teacher Education Program\nFamily and Community Sciences – Temporarily Suspended\nRecreation, Parks, and Tourism Administration\nSocial Work\nSociology\nUrban Studies and Planning\nBachelor of Science\nApparel Design and Merchandising\nConcentrations in:\nDesign\nMerchandising\nNutrition and Dietetics\nConcentrations in:\nDietetics and Nutrition Science\nFoods and Community Nutrition\nInterior Design and Architecture\nKinesiology\nConcentrations in:\nExercise and Movement Sciences\nIntegrated Teacher Education Program in Physical Education\nNursing Pre-Licensure\nNursing (RN-to-Nursing Degree)\nPublic Health\nMinor Programs\nAthletic Coaching\nCounseling\nCriminal Justice Studies\nEarly Childhood Development\nEmpowerment Self-Defense\nHolistic Health\nSexuality Studies\nJuvenile Justice\nPrison Reentry Studies\nPublic Health\nQueer and Trans Studies\nRecreation, Parks, and Tourism\nSociology\nUrban Studies and Planning\nUndergraduate Certificates\nConflict Resolution (offered jointly by the Colleges of Business, Ethnic Studies, Health and Social Sciences, and Liberal & Creative Arts)\nHolistic Health\nMaster of Arts\nFamily and Consumer Sciences\nGerontology\nHuman Sexuality Studies\nMaster of Public Administration\nMaster of Public Health\nMaster of Science\nCounseling\nCounseling\nConcentration in Marriage, Family, and Child Counseling\nKinesiology\nClinical Mental Health Counseling\nNursing\nConcentrations in\nAdult/Gero Clinical Nurse Specialist\nCommunity Public Health\nFamily Nurse Practitioner\nNursing Administration\nPediatrics Clinical Nurse Specialist\nPsychiatric Mental Health\nWoman's Health\nMaster of Social Work\nDoctor of Physical Therapy\nThe Doctor of Physical Therapy (D.P.T.)  program is offered jointly with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).\nGraduate Certificates\nClinical Laboratory Science\nDietetics\nExercise Physiology\nFamily Nurse Practitioner\nMovement Science\nPhysical Activity: Social Scientific Perspectives\nCredentials\nPupil Personnel Services\nCollege Administrative Offices\nCollege Administrative Officers\nTitle\nOfficer\nOffice\nTelephone\nDean\nDr. Andreana Clay\nHSS 336\n338-3326\nAssociate Dean\nDr. John P.

    "content": "Scholastic Distinction\nUndergraduate Students\nSatisfactory Scholarship\nAn undergraduate student working for a baccalaureate degree is expected to maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 (C) or better in all work at San Francisco State University. To be eligible for a baccalaureate degree, a student must have a GPA of at least 2.0 (C) in:\nall courses completed at San Francisco State University,\nall courses completed at the college or university level, and\nall courses in their major.\nSemester Dean’s List\nEach semester the University recognizes undergraduate students who have attained high scholastic achievement. The following criteria are used:\nThe student registered for and completed a minimum of 12 semester units for the semester. Only those courses where A-F grades were assigned are counted.\nThe student attained a GPA of 3.25 or better for the semester.\nOnly resident courses are used in computing the grade point average.\nOnly grades for the semester under consideration are used in computing the grade point average.\nGraduation with Honors\nHonors are granted with the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Science. For students who entered the University beginning fall 1996, honors are based on the cumulative GPA at the time of graduation (across all units attempted, whether in residence or transferred from other institutions). The cumulative GPA is listed as the “Overall GPA” on a student’s Degree Progress Report. The level of honors granted is determined by the GPA earned in all University and college coursework attempted according to the following scale:\nA student whose GPA is 3.50 – 3.69 shall graduate\ncum laude\n.\nA student whose GPA is 3.70 – 3.84 shall graduate\nmagna cum laude\n.\nA student whose GPA is 3.85 or greater shall graduate\nsumma cum laude\n.\nNote:\nin the calculation of honors, GPA is not rounded up and is based on the actual student GPA.\nA preliminary honors list is compiled based on all coursework completed excluding the last semester. Those meeting honors requirements on this basis are designated on the commencement program as “candidates for honors.” The final honors list is compiled at the time of final clearance for graduation and is based on all coursework completed.\nPhi Beta Kappa\nPhi Beta Kappa, the oldest honor society in the United States, maintains a chapter at San Francisco State. Known as Omicron of California, the chapter grants membership, by invitation only, to students in their senior year. Requirements for membership as established by the Phi Beta Kappa Society in Washington, D.C., and by the campus chapter are:\nA student must have completed at least 100 semester units towards graduation.\nAt least 45 of those 100 semester units must have been earned at SF State.\nA student’s GPA must place them among the top students in the graduating class. Most initiates have earned a GPA above 3.7.\nA student must be majoring in one of the liberal subjects. That means the major normally would be in some subject taught in the College of Ethnic Studies, College of Health and Social Sciences, College of Liberal & Creative Arts, or College of Science & Engineering, although not all majors in those colleges are considered liberal subjects.\nA student must have earned at least 90 semester units of credit in liberal subjects as listed above.\nApplied, professional, or vocational courses cannot be considered as qualifying for Phi Beta Kappa membership. Work in business, broadcasting, studio arts, education, engineering, and journalism courses are considered \"professional.\"\nThe student’s coursework must include a broad spectrum of studies in the sciences, humanities, and behavioral and social sciences. Evaluators are looking for depth as well as breadth and will, consequently, expect to find that a student has taken some courses beyond a mere introduction to a given subject.\nA student must have completed at least 3 units of university-level mathematics. Remedial courses will not be counted. Math courses accepted for GE are not necessarily acceptable for Phi Beta Kappa. A partial list of acceptable mathematics courses includes:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMATH 110\nBusiness Calculus\n3\nMATH 124\nElementary Statistics\n3\nMATH 165\nConcepts of the Number System\n3\nMATH 226\nCalculus I\n4\nMATH 565\nConcepts of Geometry, Measurement, and Probability\n3\nDS 110\nCalculus with Business Applications\n3\nISED 160\nData Analysis in Education\n3\nPHIL 205\nFormal Logic I\n3\nPSY 371\nPsychological Statistics\n3\nor any course for which these are a prerequisite\nA student must have studied a foreign language and be able to demonstrate an ability to read and write in that language. Evaluators will look for evidence that a student has progressed at least through three semesters of a foreign language or equivalent at the college level. Some students may have entered SF State with 6 units of Advanced Placement credit in a language and could, therefore, go directly into a third-semester language course. Students who can demonstrate that their native language was not English may count English competence as fulfilling the foreign language requirement.\nAn interested student who meets these minimum qualifications should contact their adviser for possible nomination for membership in the society.\nThe selection process starts at the beginning of the fall semester of each year. Transcripts are reviewed and a final vote on all candidates is made by the entire Chapter no later than spring. Once this vote is taken, it is impossible to elect any more new members until the following spring. New members who accept the invitation to membership are initiated at a formal ceremony, and attendance at the ceremony is required. Persons graduated at the end of the fall semester may be considered for election during the spring semester immediately following graduation. Persons graduated earlier than one semester preceding the spring election process will generally not be considered for membership.",

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nElectrical Engineering BS + Electrical and Computer Engineering MS SF State Scholars Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nTheatre Arts BA + MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in Theatre Arts\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

For directions on how to view your Pathway/Category, visit\nhow to find your pathway\n. Questions? Contact\nGator Smart Start.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 1/2\n5 Year First-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 1/2\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 3/4\nSF State Scholars Roadmap\nThe San Francisco State Scholars program provides undergraduate students with an accelerated pathway to a graduate degree. Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nCivil Engineering BS + MS SF State Scholars Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

Cooperative positions are arranged with the help of the program director and supervised by both the immediate work supervisor and a faculty coordinator from the student's area of academic interest. Participation in the Cooperative Education Program expands and enhances career opportunities through experience gained with employers and often helps focus academic objectives. Students receive competitive wages and earn academic credit while involved in their field assignments. Employment periods may be either full- or part-time. Participants begin the program by completing the preparatory Cooperative Education Colloquium course. Additional information may be obtained from the Cooperative Education Office.\nProgram Scope\nThis supplemental 25-unit certificate program is designed to give students the opportunity to develop educational objectives and career opportunities. Enrollment in the cooperative education colloquium course is a requirement for all students and is used as the basis for evaluation of student potential and interest. The certificate indicates to the employer that the University validates the student's work experience in cooperative education and substantiates the experience as professional development and job training. Students receive academic credit and salaried compensation.\nAll placements are academically relevant. Since the certificate program is tailored to the student's needs and specific major, information about various degrees and programs offered may be found under the appropriate department or center.\nCareer Outlook\nStudents who complete the certificate program typically have greater employment options and benefits.

    "content": "Master of Science in Computer Science\nProgram Description\nAll students share breadth requirements in the areas of computing foundations, computer systems, and software development. Students focusing on different areas then differ in the choice of courses that provide depth in the chosen area and the work done for the culminating experience. Students are expected to decide on a focus area prior to enrollment in the second semester. Integrated into the curriculum are significant team and project experiences. There are two options for the mandatory culminating experience, the master’s thesis or the applied research project.\nThe grading method CR/NC is allowed only for\nCSC 895\nor\nCSC 898\n. All other courses listed on the Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) form must be a letter grade.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will demonstrate a breadth of knowledge in Computer Science, as exemplified in the areas of systems, theory, and software development.\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to conduct a research or applied Computer Science project, requiring writing and presentation skills which exemplify scholarly style in Computer Science.\nElective Requirements\nAll students are required to include elective credits in their program. Electives include:\nAll upper-division or graduate courses offered by the Computer Science Department, including breadth requirement courses and\nCSC 897\nand\nCSC 899\n.\nCSC 893\nmay not count as an elective course.\nCourses from other programs such as biology, engineering, business, or mathematics may be accepted with the approval of the graduate advisor and culminating experience supervisor.\nNote:\nA maximum of 6 units of upper-division courses (numbered below 700) may be applied to the degree with the consent of the course instructor and graduate advisor.\nGraduate Seminar Requirement\nIn addition to curricular requirements, prior to enrolling in\nCSC 895\n/\nCSC 898\n, all graduate students are required to attend the Department Graduate Seminar series during one semester of their studies. These weekly seminars explore current topics in computer science research and assist students with choosing a topic for the culminating experience. Details for meeting this requirement may be found in the\nGraduate Studies Policy section\n.\nPracticum\nThis 1-3 unit option is chosen by students who wish to enhance their master’s degree by completing an industrial practicum. After finding the job in the local industry, the student will submit a research proposal to the department’s supervisor (normally the department chair) that describes the expected work and learning outcome. The department’s supervisor must approve the proposal before the student begins the research. Once approved, the student will enroll in 1 unit of\nCSC 893\n. At the conclusion of the work experience, the student must file a written report outlining the research and work experience. The report is submitted to the department’s supervisor. Students may repeat\nCSC 893\nfor a maximum of 3 units. The total number of units for the degree for students who complete the\nCSC 893\npracticum option will be 33 units. It is recommended that this option be pursued only during the summer.\nNote:\nCSC 893\nallows international students to obtain permission to work off-campus for the duration of the course.\nAdmission to Program\nAdmission to the graduate program in Computer Science is a two-step process that should be completed simultaneously:\nApply to San Francisco State University:\nComplete the on-line CSU Mentor application. Follow all other requirements for admission to the University by accessing\nwww.sfsu.edu/~gradstdy/\n.\nApply to the Department of Computer Science graduate program:\nFull details can be found at\nhttps://cs.sfsu.edu/grads/prospective-graduates\nWe encourage students with four-year degrees other than Computer Science to apply to our program as conditional applicants. Please check the link in Step 2 above for details.\nFinancial Assistance\nGraduate assistantships are occasionally available for qualified master's students. These opportunities include participating in funded research projects, assisting with the management of departmental and university computer laboratories as well as lecturer positions for beginning undergraduate computer science courses. Frequently, there are internship opportunities available for work at local companies. International students should address all questions related to their visa status and eligibility for practical training (off-campus work) to the\nOffice of International Programs\n.\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nLevel One\nComputer science students admitted to the M.S. program are required to satisfy English Level One prior to the end of their first year of study at SF State. Level One is satisfied by obtaining either a score of 4 or better on the GRE Analytical Writing Exam or a passing grade in\nSCI 614\n.\nSCI 614\nis strongly recommended for all students who wish to develop their skills in professional writing.\nLevel Two\nThe second level of proficiency in written English must be demonstrated before graduation.

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in Literature\nEnglish majors are required to complete a 45-unit program consisting of 24 units of core requirements and 21 units in an area of concentration,\nincluding a 3-unit Culminating Experience capstone course. The four concentrations offered by the English Department are\nLiterature, Linguistics, English Education, and Professional Writing and Rhetoric.\nA maximum of\nsix\nunits of lower-division coursework may be accepted for credit in the English major upon permission of an advisor.\nAdvanced Placement (A.P.) credit in composition cannot be used to fulfill the six-unit lower-division requirement in the major.\nCompletion of\nENG 480GW\nwith a grade of C or higher fulfills the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) for all English majors.\nThe Culminating Experience capstone course must be completed during either the final semester or one of the semesters of the student’s final (senior) year, depending on the English major concentration.\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant major concentration section in this Bulletin.\nThe BA in English with a concentration in Literature offers students a historically grounded study of British, American, and “post-colonial” Anglophone literatures. Our core curriculum includes a series of two upper-division survey courses (Literature in English I and II) intended to provide students with a knowledge foundation of literary movements, figures, and forms within a transatlantic context. Literature majors also take one course in linguistics, an upper-division Shakespeare course, at least one course in literary theory or criticism, and at least one course in Anglophone literature produced outside of Britain or America.\nThe Literature program offers a wide range of courses centered on specific authors (Austen, Chaucer, Woolf), historical periods (“Age of Victorians,” “American Literature 1914-1960”), genres (“Detective Fiction,” “Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction,” “Lyric Forms”), and other special topics (“18th c. Women Writers,” “Devils and Angels”), allowing students to pursue their individual interests and pleasures in fulfilling their elective units. No matter what the subject, all courses within the major foster students’ close reading, writing, and analytical skills. Literature majors can expect to hone their aptitude for writing, research, oral communication, and analytical thinking. This practical skill set prepares our majors for many career opportunities, including teaching, writing and publishing, law, information science, business and marketing, and more.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to differentiate how language use varies across the contexts and genres of professional writing and rhetoric, literature, and linguistics. (Disciplinary Knowledge)\nStudents will be able to formulate and pursue methodologically sound lines of inquiry, effectively placing their ideas side by side the ideas of others, drawing persuasively on credible primary and secondary sources. (Research)\nStudents will be able to produce rhetorically effective texts across a range of digital, print, and multimedia formats. (Written Communication/Digital Literacy)\nStudents will be able to carefully read and critically examine the ways in which culture and global context affect language, literature, and writing. (Global Perspectives)\nStudents will be able to analyze language and texts in relation to the historical and social contexts in which they are situated. (Historical Thinking)\nStudents will be able to apply critical thinking, close reading, and rhetorical persuasion to engage productively and ethically in scholarly, civic, and professional communities. (Application & Engagement)\nStudents in the literature concentration will be able to perform close readings of complex literary texts with attention to content, connotation, allusion, and thematic purpose.\nStudents in the literature concentration will be able to analyze literary genres, styles, forms, conventions, debates, and/or rhetorical devices in and among texts produced across different historical periods.\nStudents in the literature concentration will demonstrate the ability to conduct research by identifying and defining scholarly questions, accessing and assessing primary and secondary sources, developing strategies to organize and interpret research materials, and communicating their findings or arguments through a range of discipline-specific forms and genres.\nAdditional Information\nCompletion of\nENG 480GW\nwith a grade of C or higher fulfills the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) for all English majors.\nAdvanced Placement (A.P.) credit in composition cannot be used to fulfill the lower-division literature requirement in the major or minor.\nA maximum of 9 units of work in lower-division literature courses may be accepted for credit in the major with the consent of an advisor.\nEnglish (B.A.): Concentration in Literature\n— 45 Units\nCore Requirements (24 Units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nLower-Division (6 units)\nENG 218\nLiterature Is Not A Luxury: Writing For Self and Community\n3\nENG 250\nTopics in Literature and Culture\n3\nUpper-Division (18 units)\nENG 402\nIntroduction to Professional Writing and Rhetoric\n3\nENG 420\nIntroduction to the Study of Language\n3\nENG 461\nLiterature in English Since 1800\n3\nENG 480GW\nWriting in English: GWAR Seminar\n3\nENG 583\nShakespeare: Representative Plays\n3\nENG 640\nGlobal Texts and Practices\n3\nConcentration (21 Units)\nSurvey (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 460\nLiterature in English to 1800\n3\nTheory or Criticism (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 600\nTheory of Literature\n3\nENG 601\nLiterature and Psychology\n3\nENG 602\nLiterature, Identity, Society: Theoretical Approaches to Identity and Cultural Critique\n3\nENG 611\nModern Criticism\n3\nENG 612\nSerial Narrative\n3\nENG 614\nWomen in Literature: Authors and Characters\n3\nENG 615\nImagery, Metaphor, and Symbol\n3\nPre-1800 Literature (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 501\nAge of Chaucer\n3\nENG 503\nStudies in Medieval Literature\n3\nENG 510\nThe Age of Wit\n3\nENG 512\n18th-Century British Women Writers\n3\nENG 550\nThe Rise of the Novel\n3\nENG 571\nShakespeare's Rivals\n3\nENG 584\nShakespeare: Selected Plays\n3\nENG 589\nMilton\n3\nElectives (9 units)\nSelect Three:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 300/C W 501\nGraphic Memoir and Biography\n3\nENG 429\nStylistics\n3\nENG/JS/CWL 451\nJewish Literature of the Americas\n3\nENG 465\nPost-Apocalyptic Science Fiction\n3\nENG 495\nDigital Humanities and Literacies\n3\nENG 510\nThe Age of Wit\n3\nENG 512\n18th-Century British Women Writers\n3\nENG 514\nAge of the Romantics\n3\nENG 524\nContemporary American Short Story\n3\nENG 525\nStudies in American Literature\n3\nENG 526\nAge of the American Renaissance: 1830-1860\n3\nENG 527\nAmerican Literature: 1860-1914\n3\nENG 528\nAmerican Literature: 1914-1960\n3\nENG 533/JS 437/CWL 437\nHolocaust and Literature\n3\nENG 535\nLiterature and Ecology\n3\nENG/JS/WGS 546\n20th Century American Jewish Women Writers\n3\nENG 554\nModern American Novel\n3\nENG 555\nThe Short Story\n3\nENG 580\nIndividual Authors\n3\nENG 581\nJane Austen\n3\nENG 630\nSelected Studies\n3\nENG/SXS 633\nQueer(ing) Narrative Literature\n3\nENG 636\nMyth, Literature, and Adaptation\n3\nENG 655\nLiterature and the Adolescent Reader\n3\nCapstone Experience (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 690\nSenior Seminar\n3\nENG 690\nmust be completed during one of the semesters of the final (senior) year.\nStudents must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher in the major and no grade in the major lower than a C- (except for\nENG 480GW\n, which requires a grade of C or higher). A maximum of 9 units of literature classes from other departments (such as Comparative and World Literature) may be accepted for credit in the major upon the permission of an advisor.\nComplementary Studies Requirement for English Majors\nTwelve units of Complementary Studies are required of all candidates in any of the four concentrations (Literature, Linguistics, English Education, and Professional Writing and Rhetoric) in the Bachelor of Arts degree in English. These units must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ENG and must not be cross-listed with ENG. English majors will be offered four pathways for satisfying this requirement; each pathway is designed to facilitate graduation in a timely manner.\nForeign Language: 12 units in a single foreign language;\nSecond Major, Minor, or Certificate: 12 units of coursework taken as part of a second major, a minor, or a certificate;\nStudy Abroad: 12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (such as CSU Study Abroad);\nRelated Subjects: 12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an English Department advisor.\nRelated subjects typically include (but are not limited to) Comparative and World Literature, Classics, Creative Writing, Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages, History, Journalism, and Women and Gender Studies, Communication Studies, Instructional Technology, or Marketing. For these related subjects, 6 units must be from classes in a non-literary-related field.\nDepending on the concentration within the major, Complementary Studies pathway, and approval of a departmental advisor, up to 12 units from courses with non-ENG prefixes that count towards the Complementary Studies requirement may also count as English electives in fulfillment of Major requirements.\nStudents who have earned AA-T or AS-T degrees and are pursuing a similar B.A. degree at SF State are required to fulfill the Complementary Studies requirement as defined by the major department. Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor.

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nEnglish Literature SF State Scholars Roadmap\nB.A. in English: Concentration in Literature and M.A. in English: Concentration in Linguistics SF State Scholars Roadmap\nB.A. in English: Concentration in Literature and M.A. in English: Concentration in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages SF State Scholars Roadmap\nB.A. in English: Concentration in Literature and M.A. in English: Concentration in Composition SF State Scholars Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in English\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college.

Join us and become part of a racially, linguistically, and culturally diverse community of learners engaging in a dialog between our histories and experiences, and new ideas and literacies.\nLinguistics is a concentration within the English BA. At the undergraduate level, students begin to explore the patterns of sounds, words, sentences, and conversations in a variety of languages and speech communities. What similarities are found between English, Spanish, and Swahili, for example? What patterns do Turkish and Japanese share? How can you characterize the difference between “empty” and “hollow” when the dictionary lists them as synonyms? How do conversations among teenagers in San Francisco differ from conversations among 40-year-olds?\nStudents interested in any field involving language analysis — including but not limited to law, education, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and linguistics — benefit from preparation in examining language data with the rigorous methods of the discipline. Students who plan to teach language to gain a valuable background in the structure of English along with a deeper understanding of how languages are acquired. Undergraduate majors are encouraged to take courses in other languages as well as courses investigating language from the perspectives of other fields, such as speech and communication, psychology, computer science, and anthropology.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to differentiate how language use varies across the contexts and genres of professional writing and rhetoric, literature, and linguistics.

Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor. For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with one of the pathways below:\nGeneral ADT Roadmap\nAA-T Communication Studies\nAS-T Computer Science\nAA-T English\nAA-T Global Studies\nAA-T Social Justice Studies\nAA-T Spanish\nSF State Scholars Roadmap\nThe San Francisco State Scholars program provides undergraduate students with an accelerated pathway to a graduate degree. Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nEnglish (Linguistics) BA + English (Linguistics) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nEnglish (Linguistics) BA + English (TESOL) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nEnglish (Linguistics) BA + English (Composition) MA State SF Scholars Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in English\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Science in Business Administration: Concentration in Finance\nConcentration in Finance\nThe Finance concentration teaches students to recognize, understand, and attain the skills necessary to be successful in the world of finance. It focuses on the financial decisions made in every organization, which include investment, decisions in purchasing and selling real and financial assets, raising cash to fund these investments, and managing the risk of its assets and investments. Other operational decisions include implementing routine day-to-day procedures to manage all financial aspects of the organization and decisions regarding changes in the mix of its services and products. Although a financial manager specializes in these decisions, managers from across the organization also contribute.\nFour sets of skills are essential to financial decision-making: First, an understanding of the environment within which decisions are made, including both the internal structure of the organization and the nature of external capital and financial markets; second, familiarity with the organization’s information system, including accounting, financial, and human resources; third, analysis of available financial data to understand the likely impact of alternative decisions and their level of uncertainty; finally, understanding the interrelationships between financial decisions and decisions made in other parts of the organization, such as marketing, production, and IT.\nAll concentration courses must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Students must maintain an overall minimum grade point average of 2.0 across the seven concentration courses.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nBusiness Knowledge and Integration\nDemonstrate knowledge of core business disciplines and integrate concepts across functional areas to solve problems.\nBusiness Communication\nCommunicate business information effectively in written and oral formats for diverse audiences.\nCritical Thinking and Problem Solving\nApply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to analyze complex business situations and recommend reasoned solutions.\nQuantitative and Technological Proficiency\nUse quantitative methods and appropriate technologies to analyze data and support business decisions.\nTeamwork and Inclusion\nCollaborate effectively in diverse teams, demonstrating leadership and respectful communication in accomplishing team goals.\nEthics, Sustainability and Global Perspective\nEvaluate business decisions from ethical, sustainable, and global perspectives, considering diverse stakeholders and environments.\nBachelor of Science in Business Administration: Concentration in Finance\n— 69 Units Minimum\nExcept in cases of credit by examination, no more than 6 units of the core may be completed on a CR/NC basis.\nStudents must earn a grade of C- or better in core Business courses required as prerequisites for other core Business courses.\nAll concentration courses must be taken on a letter-grade basis.

For directions on how to view your Pathway/Category, visit\nhow to find your pathway\n. Questions? Contact\nGator Smart Start.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 1/2\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 3/4\nTransfer Student Roadmaps\nFor students with an AS-T in\nBusiness Administration\nwith 18 units in the major satisfied.\nBUS ADT Roadmap with 18 Lower-Division Units\nFor students with an AS-T in\nBusiness Administration\nwith 15 units in the major satisfied.\nBUS ADT Roadmap with 15 Lower-Division Unit\ns\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "title": "Master of Fine Arts in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Master of Fine Arts in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts\nThe Department of Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts (BECA) Graduate Program is a premier program designed for students pursuing an advanced education in media arts, whether it be in television and radio production, writing, business, management, digital and multimedia production and content delivery, or pedagogy. This broad, theory-driven approach is designed to encourage students to think critically about the many facets of the media industry, the content they produce, and the impact it has on our culture and communities. BECA graduate students can pursue one of two degree options:\nThe 30-unit, two-year MA in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts reflects a comprehensive view of communication arts with an integration of theory and practice. The purpose of the MA is to offer students the opportunity to engage in advanced academic inquiry and scholarship in broadcast, electronic, and digital media, and to critically apply this knowledge to media and other fields. Candidates can choose from two culminating experiences: the comprehensive examination or a thesis.\nThe 60-unit, three-year MFA in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts complements the department’s 30-unit MA degree. The purpose of the MFA is to prepare students to practice and teach in the field. It emphasizes the academic intersection between theory, research, and practice. The culminating experience is a creative project, the possibilities of which can be television or radio scripts, fully produced television, podcasts, or radio programs, sound recording and design, and social media producing and marketing. ALL MFA students are expected to develop a personal aesthetic and develop conceptual clarity to include distribution (getting their work in front of audiences).\nThe degree path for all MFA students includes three foundation areas:\nBroadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Theory, History and Criticism\nBroadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Practice\nPedagogy in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts\nIndividualized programs for the BECA MFA degree are designed in consultation with the graduate advisor.\nGraduate students admitted conditionally to the MFA program will submit a portfolio for a creative project in their second year of study. If the faculty does not approve the portfolio, the student may apply to transfer to the MA program and graduate after completing all required MA coursework and the comprehensive exam. If the portfolio is approved, coursework from the MA program is applied to the MFA degree. The student will complete a third and final year to earn the MFA.\nAdmissions Requirements:\nSan Francisco State University requires applicants to graduate programs to have a GPA of 3.0 or better. Applicants with undergraduate degrees in all areas related to the media arts will be considered. Applicants who do not meet these criteria may petition the department for admission.\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nEach graduate student must demonstrate the ability to write standard American English correctly and effectively. To assure that each graduate student has the desired proficiency in written English, two distinct assessments are made:\nLevel One (Preadmission)\nLevel One writing is demonstrated with an Analytical Writing score on the GRE of 4.5 or higher. Students who fail to demonstrate Level One writing preadmission may be admitted conditionally but will be required to take a department-administered writing test during the first week of their first semester. If they fail to pass this writing test, they will be required to take remedial writing courses before enrolling in 700-level or 800- level courses other than BECA 700 and BECA 702. The remedial writing classes cannot be used on the ATC.

    "content": "Master of Arts in English: Concentration in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages\nOverview\nTESOL is one of three concentrations within the M.A. in English.\nThe M.A. in TESOL provides students with a solid grounding in theory, research, and practice of teaching English as a second or international language to diverse language learner populations.\nGraduate courses focus on theoretical foundations of the field: second language acquisition, pedagogical grammar, teaching reading and writing, listening and speaking, adult literacy instruction, curriculum and assessment development, and reflective teaching practice. In the culminating experience class (\nENG 895\n, students create a portfolio containing teaching materials, a statement of teaching philosophy, a capstone project paper as well as other materials relevant to their professional growth and careers.\nThe M.A. in TESOL prepares students for teaching in a variety of teaching and research positions. Most graduates of the program obtain positions teaching in community colleges, 4-year colleges, or universities both in the US and abroad. Some graduates also join programs such as the US State Department, ELFs, Peace Corps, and Fulbright ETAs. Graduates also work in a variety of language teaching centers, educational programs, and fields related to communication.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nEnglish M.A. students will critically evaluate scholarship using knowledge of disciplinary history, foundational theories, epistemologies, and scholarly debates to participate in professional communities of Composition, TESOL, and Linguistics.\nEnglish M.A. students will conduct principled inquiry (critical reflection, observation, and/or formal research) using appropriate methods and tools of analysis to address disciplinary questions and problems of practice.\nEnglish M.A. students will produce effective written and oral presentations that follow professional disciplinary standards of Composition, TESOL, and Linguistics.\nEnglish M.A. students will apply pedagogical knowledge and skills to the teaching of language, literacy, or linguistics.\nStudents in the TESOL M.A. concentration will articulate a coherent teaching philosophy that has been informed by practical experience and knowledge of relevant teaching principles and research.\nStudents in the TESOL M.A. concentration will create appropriate lessons and curricula for multilingual English language learners.\nStudents in the TESOL M.A. concentration will produce critical reflections on teaching practices and materials and how they embody educational values of ethics, social justice, diversity, and globalization.\nAdmission to Program\nApplicants submit all materials through the Cal State Apply portal (\nhttps://calstate.liaisoncas.com\n).\nApplication materials include:\nA\n1 to 2-page statement of purpose\n. Using the suggested prompts, applicants should discuss their interest in pursuing the MA program; their relevant language learning or teaching or tutoring experience, if applicable; their readiness to meet the rigors of graduate-level coursework; and their future professional goals.\nA\n5 to 10-page writing sample\n. This can be an academic paper and/or a sample of writing from a professional setting. The sample should demonstrate the applicant’s ability to produce clear, concise, well-polished prose.\nLetters of recommendation\n. Letters are optional; however, we encourage those students who have weaknesses in their prior academic record to submit one or two letters in support of their application.\nTranscripts\n.

    "content": "Master of Science in Geosciences\nProgram Advisor: John Caskey\nThe Master of Science in Geosciences provides an advanced degree that prepares students to work in private industry or government agencies, teach in community colleges or high schools, or continue postgraduate studies leading to a doctoral degree at another university. The graduate program also gives professional geoscientists an opportunity to update and upgrade their job skills.\nThe School of the Environment’ faculty has expertise in geology, meteorology, oceanography, and paleoclimate –fields critical to understanding many environmental problems, such as air and water contamination, active faulting, coastal erosion, and global warming. There are no formal concentrations within the M.S. program, but most students choose to emphasize research that is aligned with the faculty area of expertise. We encourage students to work on interdisciplinary projects, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also encourage students to develop linkages with other departments in the university, and with agencies and firms in the local region.\nAll students take courses in their respective areas of emphasis plus a common core of three courses:\nERTH 700\n, a multidisciplinary seminar that exposes students to current geoscientific research and literature, and\nERTH 701\nand\nERTH 702\n, which prepare students for thesis research, quantitative analyses and scientific writing. Thesis projects are expected to have a rigorous base in a geoscience discipline. Depending on the particular field and focus of study, these projects can involve laboratory research, fieldwork, theory development, numerical simulations or model development.\nRecent graduate research projects have focused on topics such as active faults in Death Valley, effects of climate change on regional aquifers, geomorphic controls on Bay Area streams, deformation associated with the San Andreas fault system, Pliocene–Pleistocene climate change, large-scale tectonic processes in the Himalayan Mountains, carbon cycling in the ocean, wave erosion at Ocean Beach, and characteristics of severe storms in California. We encourage students to work on interdisciplinary projects and develop interactions and collaborations with other departments in the University, other institutions and agencies, and private industry.\nWe strongly recommend that students plan a course of study before beginning the M.S. program, in consultation with a faculty advisor and the graduate coordinator.\nAdmission to the Program\nThe School of the Environment is committed to recruiting and supporting a diverse group of graduate students with the potential to develop into excellent scientists.  We offer limited financial support in the following ways:\nThe John A. and Anna Monteverdi Fellowship\nThe Monteverdi Fellowship provides one year of significant support to graduate students in the School of the Environment who are specializing in atmospheric science, oceanography, or climate science and who demonstrate outstanding academic merit and financial need. The fellowship award of $10,000 can be used to pay for tuition, fees, books, and any other expenses that you may incur.  A condition of the fellowship is that you register for 6 or more units each semester.\nThe Professor Emerita Karen Grove and Jay Ach Fellowship Teaching fellowship\nThe Grove/Ach Fellowship provides two years of significant support to graduate students who demonstrate exceptional promise of achievement in the M.S. program in Geosciences. The fellowship award of $10,000 per academic year (renewal for second academic year contingent on good research progress) can be used to pay for tuition, fees, books, and any other expenses that you may incur.  A condition of the fellowship is that you register for 6 or more units each semester.\nThe Department Teaching Fellowship\nThe Teaching Fellowship is designed to support students with a strong interest in strengthening their teaching and communication skills in addition to their scientific research.  The fellowship provides the opportunity to teach up to two sections for two years (contingent on strong student and faculty evaluations of their teaching).  Students with this fellowship will be required to attend\nSCI 750\nScience Teaching for Scientists I\n.\nOther Sources of Support\nDepending on available funding, the School of the Environment or individual faculty may be able to support additional students as Graduate Teaching Assistants, student assistant, or research assistants.\nApplication Process\nA critical step to being accepted to the MS Program in the School of the Environment is identifying a research mentor. We therefore strongly encourage students to email faculty they are interested in working with.\nTo be considered for admission to the master's program as a classified graduate student, applicants must:\nSatisfy the University admission requirements.\nHave a bachelor's degree in one of the geosciences (geology, meteorology, or oceanography) or a related discipline.\nHave a 3.0 GPA in their earned undergraduate degree or last 60 semester (90 quarter) units completed.\nProvide letters of recommendation from at least two people familiar with the applicant’s previous academic work and/or professional accomplishments.\nSubmit a statement of purpose. The statement should address the following questions\nWhat are your main research interests and why?\nWhich faculty member(s) are you interested in working with directly?\nDescribe your financial need\nDescribe your interest in teaching and/or your interest as working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.\nApplicants lacking the appropriate background may be admitted as conditionally classified graduate students. These students must complete additional coursework that will not be counted toward the degree requirements. Conditionally admitted students may take courses but cannot file an Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) form until all deficiencies have been satisfied.\nAll application material should be submitted at\nhttps://www2.calstate.edu/apply\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nEach graduate student is required to demonstrate an acceptable level of written English proficiency on two levels:\nLevel One\nWritten English proficiency will be assessed on the basis of the Statement of Purpose. Students who demonstrate a need for additional writing support will be required to take a graduate-level writing class.\nLevel Two\nSatisfied by completion of a written thesis (\nERTH 898\n).\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the Master of Science in Geosciences:\nStudents can access information about previous research that is relevant to their own study, and they can organize that information and incorporate it into their writing (thesis proposal and thesis manuscript).\nStudents can formulate a research question and develop a detailed plan to address their research question.\nStudents can work independently to collect appropriate data and evaluate its quality.\nStudents can use quantitative methods to analyze research data.\nStudents can write clear, well-organized explanations of their research goals, methods, results, and implications.\nStudents can obtain entrance into a doctoral program or find employment in their filed of interest.\nAdvancement to Candidacy\nTo be advanced to candidacy, each student must:\nSatisfy level one of the written English proficiency requirement.\nSatisfy all course deficiencies stipulated upon entrance into the master's program.\nChoose a faculty advisor and complete a research proposal that has been approved by the student's thesis committee.\nFile an Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) form.\nGeosciences (M.S.)\n— Minimum 30 units\nRequired Courses (17 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nERTH 700\nGraduate Seminar in Geosciences\n2\nERTH 701\nResearch Methods in Geosciences\n3\nERTH 702\nQuantitative Methods in Geosciences\n3\nERTH 897\nResearch Project\n6\nERTH 898\nMaster's Thesis\n3\nElective Courses (13 units)\nUpper division or graduate elective courses on advisement.\nAll students must present an oral thesis defense to the Earth & Climate Sciences faculty and students.\nElective units are chosen from courses offered by the Department or other University departments, and must be selected by students in consultation with their faculty advisors. At least 6 units must be courses numbered 700 or higher, and 6 units must be courses offered in the Earth & Climate Sciences Department.\nTo help prepare for their careers, graduate students are strongly encouraged to serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) for at least one semester. GTAs typically teach lab sections attached to lectures in introductory, general education courses in geology (\nERTH 112\n,\nERTH 210\n,\nERTH 230\n), meteorology (\nERTH 162\n), and oceanography (\nERTH 172\n). To support their professional development in teaching, GTAs are strongly encouraged to enroll in a professional development course such as\nSCI 750\n(2 units) before or during their service as a GTA, to learn about research-based best practices in teaching and learning. (These courses count toward the 13-unit graduate elective unit requirement.)\nStudents can receive their graduate degree when they complete all course requirements and their thesis committee approves the written thesis and oral thesis defense.",

Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Philosophy\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts\nDean: Dr. Ifeoma Kiddoe Nwankwo\nDepartment of Philosophy\nHumanities Building, Room 388\nPhone: (415) 338-1596\nWebsite:\nhttp://philosophy.sfsu.edu/\nChair: David Landy\nProgram Scope\nThe Department of Philosophy offers students a broad education in the history of thought, development of powerful reasoning skills, and opportunities to apply their insights and skills to areas of personal and professional interest.\nAn education in philosophy is beneficial in almost all parts of life. Generally speaking, philosophical education is eminently valuable for careers that call for analysis and evaluation of problems, smart solutions, critical and creative thinking and writing, and powerful advocacy of one's beliefs and values. Our degree programs develop students’ potential for independent thought and intellectual creativity. Philosophy students score extremely well on the admission tests required by various post-baccalaureate professional schools. A double major in philosophy complements and enhances other degrees, whether in the sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, or professional studies.\nStudents can choose a degree program that includes both general theories in the different philosophical fields and philosophy as applied in different areas of understanding (the B.A. in Philosophy), or a degree that intersects philosophy and religion with a focus on the diverse forms experiences of spirituality can take (the B.A. in Philosophy and Religion), or a program that emphasizes foundations of law, public policy, and rights (the B.A. in Philosophy with an Emphasis in Philosophy and Law).  The department’s programs also recognize students’ diversity of interests by allowing a great deal of flexibility in choosing program content\nStudents may double-major, combining the skills, perspectives, and knowledge acquired in the Philosophy major with a pre-professional, social science, liberal arts, healthcare, human services, liberal studies, education, business, biological, pre-medicine, physical or computer science degree.  A double major in Philosophy complements and enhances other degrees, whether in the sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, or professional studies.\nGraduate Program\nThe Master of Arts in Philosophy is designed for students wishing to extend their knowledge of, and competence in, philosophy; for students seeking a teaching career where the master’s degree is required; and for students who are planning to do further study elsewhere. The program is wide-ranging and flexible, enabling students to concentrate on a number of different areas within philosophy.\nCareer Outlook\nA principal reason for the study of philosophy and/or religion is the enrichment of one's own life and understanding. Fortunately, the study of philosophy is also excellent preparation for a variety of post-baccalaureate professional studies and careers in law, medicine, public policy and strategic planning, the helping professions, computer-assisted enterprises, and innovative business and non-profit organizations.\nThe broader outlook and the ability to think critically about larger issues that are fostered by the systematic study of philosophy and religion are often highly valued by commercial firms in their management-level personnel. Some students continue on to graduate work in philosophy or religious studies. SF State graduates are currently teaching in colleges across the country. And opportunities to teach philosophy in K-12 have increased as educators realize the importance of enhancing children’s critical thinking skills. The philosophy and religion program is a strong foundation for the helping professions, the ministry, and advanced studies in theology. The skills that are achieved by minoring in Philosophy or Philosophy and Religion are an excellent complement to most University major programs.\nProfessor\nMohammad Azadpur (2003),\nProfessor in Philosophy\n.

    "title": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in English Education  | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in English Education\nGeneral Information\nEnglish majors are required to complete a 45-unit program consisting of 24 units of core requirements and 21 units in an area of concentration,\nincluding a 3-unit Culminating Experience capstone course. The four concentrations offered by the English Department are\nLiterature, Linguistics, English Education, and Professional Writing and Rhetoric.\nA maximum of\nsix\nunits of lower-division coursework may be accepted for credit in the English major upon consent of an advisor.\nAdvanced Placement (A.P.) credit in composition cannot be used to fulfill the six-unit lower-division requirement in the major.\nCompletion of\nENG 480GW\nwith a grade of C or higher fulfills the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) for all English majors.\nThe Culminating Experience capstone course must be completed during either the final semester or one of the semesters of the student’s final (senior) year, depending on the concentration.\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant major concentration section in this Bulletin.\nThe\nBA in English with a concentration in English Education aims to help students develop the subject-matter knowledge to enter credential programs to become English Language Arts teachers at the secondary level, in a middle or high school. The program includes a range of literature classes, courses in the theory and practice of literacy teaching and learning, linguistics and communication classes, service learning in local public schools and a choice of an emphasis area (literature, drama, linguistics, or creative writing). The program culminates with students compiling reflective electronic portfolios, a capstone that emphasizes the constructivist philosophy of the program — the belief that students actively make meaning as they learn.\nIndividuals who want to become teachers who do not pursue the English Education concentration can establish English subject-matter competency by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers or earning a degree in English with any concentration. In some cases, parts of the CSET exam may be waived for candidates without an English degree they satisfy specific courses requirements (contact an advisor for more information).\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to differentiate how language use varies across the contexts and genres of professional writing and rhetoric, literature, and linguistics. (Disciplinary Knowledge)\nStudents will be able to formulate and pursue methodologically sound lines of inquiry, effectively placing their ideas side by side the ideas of others, drawing persuasively on credible primary and secondary sources. (Research)\nStudents will be able to produce rhetorically effective texts across a range of digital, print, and multimedia formats. (Written Communication/Digital Literacy)\nStudents will be able to carefully read and critically examine the ways in which culture and global context affect language, literature, and writing. (Global Perspectives)\nStudents will be able to analyze language and texts in relation to the historical and social contexts in which they are situated. (Historical Thinking)\nStudents will be able to apply critical thinking, close reading, and rhetorical persuasion to engage productively and ethically in scholarly, civic, and professional communities. (Application & Engagement)\nStudents in the English Education concentration will achieve proficiency across English/Language Arts domains (Reading; Communications; Composition and Rhetoric; Language, Linguistics, and Literacy) as required for subject matter competency in English Education.\nStudents in the English Education concentration will demonstrate the pedagogical content-knowledge and dispositions appropriate for pre-service teachers.\nEnglish (B.A.): Concentration in English Education\n– 45 units minimum\nStudents must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher in the major, and no grade in the major lower than a C- (except for\nENG 480GW\n, which requires a grade of C or higher).\nCore Requirements (24 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nLower-Division (6 units)\nENG 218\nLiterature Is Not A Luxury: Writing For Self and Community\n3\nENG 250\nTopics in Literature and Culture\n3\nUpper-Division (18 units)\nENG 402\nIntroduction to Professional Writing and Rhetoric\n3\nENG 420\nIntroduction to the Study of Language\n3\nENG 461\nLiterature in English Since 1800\n3\nENG 480GW\nWriting in English: GWAR Seminar\n3\nENG 583\nShakespeare: Representative Plays\n3\nENG 640\nGlobal Texts and Practices\n3\nConcentration Requirements (21-22 units)\nApplied Linguistics (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 423\nLanguage Analysis for Language Teachers\n3\nENG 425\nSociolinguistics\n3\nENG 426\nSecond Language Acquisition\n3\nLiterature: Adolescent (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 655\nLiterature and the Adolescent Reader\n3\nLiteracy (3 units)\nIncludes 25 hours of community service learning.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 417\nAcademic Literacy and the Urban Adolescent\n3\nAdvanced Composition (3 units)\nIncludes 20 hours of community service learning.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 419\nAdvanced Composition for Teachers\n3\nMythology and Oral Traditions (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nAIS 162\nAmerican Indian Oral Literature\n3\nCLAS 230\nAncient Epic Tales\n3\nCWL 250\nFables and Tales\n3\nCWL 260\nMyths of the World\n3\nCWL 421\nCeltic Literature\n3\nENG 636\nMyth, Literature, and Adaptation\n3\nLTNS 435\nOral History, Community Memory, and Collective Stories\n3\nSpeech Performance (3-4 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nCOMM 220\nIntroduction to the Performance of Literature\n3\nCOMM 553\nPerformance and Identity\n4\nCapstone Experience (3 units)\nThis course must be completed during the final semester and will include an English Education e-portfolio.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 688\nAssessment in English Language Arts\n3\nElectronic Portfolio\nCandidates in English Education must register for\nENG 688\nduring their final semester, when they will compile an electronic portfolio to demonstrate that they have met all of the core outcomes of the Single Subject Program. They should include artifacts—examples of their work, and faculty and peer comments on their work—and reflections that explicitly tie elements of the artifacts to the outcome statements.\nComplementary Studies Requirement for English Majors\nTwelve units of Complementary Studies are required of all candidates in any of the four concentrations (Literature, Linguistics, English Education and Professional Writing and Rhetoric) in the Bachelor of Arts degree in English. These units must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ENG, and must not be cross-listed with ENG. English majors will be offered four pathways for satisfying this requirement; each pathway is designed to facilitate graduation in a timely manner.\nForeign Language: 12 units in a single foreign language;\n2nd Major, Minor, or Certificate: 12 units of coursework taken as part of a second major, a minor or a certificate;\nStudy Abroad: 12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (such as CSU Study Abroad);\nRelated Subjects: 12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an English Department advisor.\nRelated subjects typically include (but are not limited to) Comparative and World Literature, Classics, Creative Writing, Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages, History, Journalism, and Women and Gender Studies, Communication Studies, Instructional Technology, or Marketing. For these related subjects, six units must be from classes in a non-literary related field.\nDepending on the concentration within the major, Complementary Studies pathway, and approval of a departmental advisor, up to 12 units from courses with non-ENG prefixes that count towards the Complementary Studies requirement may also count as English electives in fulfillment of degree requirements.\nStudents who have earned AA-T or AS-T degrees and are pursuing a similar B.A. degree at SF State are required to fulfill the Complementary Studies requirement as defined by the major department. Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor. For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with one of the pathways below:\nADT Roadmap\nAA-T Child & Adolescent Development\nAS-T Early Childhood Education\nAA-T Elementary Teacher Education\nAA-T English\nAA-T Global Studies\nAA-T Social Justice Studies\nAA-T Theater Arts\nAA-T Spanish\nSF State Scholars Roadmap\nThe San Francisco State Scholars program provides undergraduate students with an accelerated pathway to a graduate degree. Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nEnglish (English Education) BA + English (Composition) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nEnglish (English Education) BA + English (Linguistics) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nEnglish (English Education) BA + English (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "title": "Graduate Application and Admissions Procedures | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Graduate Application and Admissions Procedures\nAdmission Procedures and Policies\nRequirements for admission to San Francisco State University are in accordance with Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3, of the\nCalifornia Code of Regulations\n. Complete information is available on\nthe California State University website\n.\nAll CSU applications must be submitted online on\nthe Cal State Apply website\n. An acknowledgment will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.\nImportance of Filing Complete, Accurate, and Authentic Application Documents\nSan Francisco State University advises prospective students that they must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire and financial aid forms. Further, applicants must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).\nUndergraduate Application Procedures\nProspective students applying for part-time or full-time undergraduate programs of study must submit a completed undergraduate application. The $70 nonrefundable application fee should be paid online at the time of application via credit card or PayPal and may not be transferred or used to apply to another term. An alternate major may be requested on the application if desired by the university. The applications of persons denied admission to an impacted university may be redirected to another university at no cost, but only if the applicant is CSU eligible.\nImpacted Programs\nThe CSU designates programs as impacted when more applications from regularly eligible applicants are received in the initial filing period (October and November for fall terms, June for winter terms, August for spring terms, February for summer terms) than can be accommodated. Some programs are impacted at every university which they are offered; others are impacted only at a few universities.\nCandidates for admission must meet all of the university's specified supplementary admission criteria if applying to an impacted program or university.\nThe CSU will announce during the fall filing period those CSUs or programs that are impacted. Detailed information on university and program impaction is available on the Impaction at the CSU website.\nEach university will communicate supplementary admission criteria for all impacted programs to high schools and community colleges in their application service area and will disseminate this information to the public through appropriate media. This information will also be published on the San Francisco State University website at\nsfsu.edu\n.\nApplicants must file applications for admission to an impacted program during the initial filing period. Applicants who wish to be considered for impacted programs at more than one CSU should file an application at each university for which they seek admission consideration.\nSupplementary Admission Criteria\nEach university with impacted programs or class-level admission categories uses supplementary admission criteria in screening applicants. Supplementary criteria may include rank-ordering of freshman applicants based on the combination of student's \"A-G\" GPA and supplemental factors or rank-ordering of transfer applicants based on verification of the Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) or Associate in Science Transfer (AS-T) degrees, the overall transfer grade point average (GPA), completion of specified prerequisite courses and a combination of campus-developed criteria. Applicants for freshman admission to impacted universities or programs may need to have a higher \"a-g\" GPA. In no case will standardized test scores be utilized in making freshman admission decisions.\nThe supplementary admission criteria used by individual CSUs to screen applicants are made available by the universities to all applicants seeking admission to an impacted program.\nImportance of Filing Complete, Accurate, and Authentic Application Documents\nSan Francisco State University advises prospective students that they must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire and financial aid forms. Further, applicants must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).\nApplication Acknowledgment\nOn-time applicants may expect to receive an e-mail acknowledgement from the universities to which they have applied within two to four weeks of filing the application.  The notice may include a request that applicants submit additional records necessary to evaluate academic qualifications. Unless specific written approval/confirmation is received, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another university.\nReservation\nThe University reserves the right to select its students and deny admission to the University or any of its programs as the University, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate based on an applicant's suitability and the best interests of the University.\nAppeal of Admission Decision\nSection 89030.7 of the California Education Code requires that the CSU establishes specific requirements for appeal procedures for a denial of admission. Each CSU must publish appeal procedures for applicants denied admission to the university. The procedure is limited to addressing university decisions to deny an applicant admission to the university.\nAdmission appeal procedures must address the basis for appeals, provide 15 business days for an applicant to submit an appeal, stipulate a maximum of one appeal per academic term, provide specific contact information for the individual or office to which the appeal should be submitted and indicate a time estimate for when the university expects to respond to an appeal. The appeal procedures must be included in all denial of admission notifications to students and must also be published on the university website.\nApplication Procedures\nGraduate and Post-Baccalaureate Application Procedures\nAll graduate and post-baccalaureate applicants (i.e., doctorate, joint Ph.D. applicants, master's degree applicants, those seeking educational credentials or certificates and, where permitted, holders of baccalaureate degrees interested in taking courses for personal or professional growth or seeking a second bachelor’s degree) must file a complete graduate application as described in the graduate and post-baccalaureate admission materials on the Cal State Apply website.  Applicants who completed undergraduate degree requirements in the preceding term are also required to complete and submit an application and the $70 nonrefundable application fee. To be assured of initial consideration by more than one CSU, it is necessary to submit separate applications (including fees) to each. All CSU applications must be submitted online via the Cal State Apply website. An acknowledgement will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.\nApplication Filing Periods\nTerms\nApplications First Accepted\nInitial Filing Period\nFall Semester or Quarter\nOctober 1\nOctober 1 - November 30\nWinter Quarter\nJune 1\nJune 1 - 30\nSpring Semester or Quarter\nAugust 1\nAugust 1 - 31\nSummer Semester or Quarter\n(\nMost CSUs do not admit students to summer term\n.)\nFebruary 1\nFebruary 1 - 28\nFiling Period Duration\nEach non-impacted university accepts applications until capacities are reached. Many universities limit undergraduate admission in an enrollment category due to overall enrollment limits. If applying after the initial filing period, consult the university admission office for current information\nApplication Acknowledgement\nOn time applicants may expect to receive an e-mail acknowledgement from the universities to which they have applied within two to four weeks of filing the application. The notice may include a request that applicants submit additional records necessary to evaluate academic qualifications. Applicants may be assured of admission if the evaluation of relevant qualifications indicates that applicants meet CSU admission requirements, and in the case of admission impaction, supplemental criteria for admission to an impacted program. Unless specific written approval/confirmation is received, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another university.\nHardship Petitions\nThe university has established procedures for consideration of qualified applicants who would be faced with extreme hardship if not admitted. Petitioners should write to the university Admission Office regarding specific policies governing hardship admission. For more information about\nSan Francisco State Graduate Admissions visit their website\n.\nAll program-specific supporting materials for graduate applicants must be uploaded in\nCal State Apply\n.  Retroactive admission and/or award of degree or certificate is prohibited for students who complete coursework in a program to which they have not been officially admitted. Applicants seeking prerequisites for entry to a graduate degree program should contact the Division of Graduate Studies. The\nCal State Apply\nonline application system does not allow applicants to apply to more than one San Francisco State graduate program per application term.  If you are not selected for admission to your preferred program, contact Graduate Studies for an alternate program.\nApplicants seeking second baccalaureate admission must obtain written support for admission from the Academic Department Chair of the intended program of study and contact the Division of Graduate Studies for procedures and forms to be considered for admission.\nOfficial Transcript Requirement\nAll applications are reviewed based on unofficial transcripts uploaded to the Cal State Apply online application. Applicants offered admission must provide the Division of Graduate Studies with one official transcript from each college or university attended, including community college and study abroad coursework. Separate transcripts from each college or university are required even though one transcript may show coursework taken at another institution. Transcripts for coursework completed at San Francisco State are not required. Official transcripts must be submitted in envelopes sealed by the issuing college or university. Copies of transcripts or opened official transcripts will not be accepted. Official transcripts sent electronically from authorized agencies, such as Script Safe, eScript, and etranscripts, must be sent to\ngraddocs@sfsu.edu\n. Transcripts that have been submitted for admission or evaluation become the property of the University and are not returned or copied for distribution outside of the University.\nEntrance Examination/Standardized Test Scores\nThe University does not require applicants to complete an entrance examination as a condition for graduate admission; however, many departments or programs do require that graduate degree applicants submit results of the general or area tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) prior to admission. Check the department website for test requirements. Applicants are responsible for having the required examination results forwarded directly to the University or department. San Francisco State’s GRE institution code is 4684. Our GMAT institution codes are F87HP99 for the M.B.A., and F87HP10 for the Master of Science in Accountancy programs.\nPre-admission Writing Assessment\nThe University requires that all applicants meet a pre-admission (Level I) writing standard prior to entering a graduate program. Departments or programs stipulate the pre-admission writing standards appropriate to their discipline. Departments may require a specific score range on the analytical writing section of the GRE or GMAT or faculty will assess graduate-level writing with a department/program administered writing exam or essay. Students who do not meet Level I writing standards, but meet other admissions requirements, may be admitted with specific conditions stipulated by the department. Conditions for meeting Level I writing standards should be met no later than the second consecutive semester after admission.\nProgram Application Materials\nLetters of recommendation, statements of purpose, writing samples, and résumé materials required by the department or program must be submitted as part of your\nCal State Apply\nonline application. Check the department/program website for requirements.  All application materials submitted to the University, academic department, or graduate program become the property of the University and will not be returned. In selected cases in which an applicant has submitted a portfolio of original work for review by a program admission committee, the original works may be returned if the applicant makes the necessary arrangements with the department and provides a stamped, self-addressed envelope or package for return mailing.\nApplicants from Institutions without Regional Accreditation\nAn applicant who is a graduate of an institution without regional accreditation, or from an institution whose degree is not considered equivalent to a baccalaureate degree from this University in terms of quality and/or content (e.g., specialized, professional, or certain international institutions), may not be admitted directly to graduate or credential status at San Francisco State. Applicants from non-accredited institutions should contact the Senior Associate Director of Graduate Admissions to determine alternative preparation for graduate study. Additional coursework at the undergraduate level may be required. Information about regionally accredited universities can be found at\nthe Council for Higher Education website\n(\nwww.chea.org\n). International students should review the International Student Admission Requirements section below.\nAdmissions information\nGraduate and Post-Baccalaureate Admission Requirements\nAdmission Requirements\nGraduate and post-baccalaureate applicants may apply for a degree objective, a credential or certificate objective, or where approved, may have no program objective. Depending on the objective, the CSU will consider an application for admission as follows:\nGeneral Requirements — The minimum requirements for admission to graduate and post-baccalaureate studies at a CSU are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations.\nSpecifically, a student shall at",

The department offers a broad curriculum covering the major areas of the computing discipline, integrated with soft skills such as teamwork and written/oral communication; students also gain experience working on group projects. Students are exposed to the fundamentals of computing architecture and computing theory, and focus their studies on the areas of software and systems development. Faculty work directly with students to help them develop the skills and knowledge of computing professionals.\nDepartment faculty are committed to teaching excellence. They remain current in the rapidly changing field of computing technology through continuing research and publications, direct consultation with local industries, and seminar programs that bring top researchers and industry leaders to campus to speak on current developments in the field. The Supervised Industrial Research Program, Practicum option, and other mechanisms provide opportunities for graduate students to complement their academic learning with real-world experience.\nThe department has an additional commitment to sharing its knowledge and skills with the rest of the University community, with local schools, and with community-based organizations in the Bay Area.\nThe Bachelor of Science program stresses a basic foundation in mathematics and physics, and a thorough study of the fundamentals of the discipline: software development, computer architecture, operating systems, programming languages, algorithms, and the theoretical foundations of computer science. A wide variety of elective courses such as mobile development, web/internet applications, bioinformatics, database systems, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, game development, and software engineering allow students to specialize in selected areas. Ethical and social issues of computing are discussed throughout the curriculum. Senior courses include group projects to better prepare students for future job markets. Courses are updated or added regularly to provide necessary training in the latest software technologies.\nThe Master of Science in Computer Science prepares students for a wide variety of careers in computing or related industries as well as for advanced study toward Ph.D. degrees. Our program combines a solid and practical curriculum with high-quality research and project-based activities. In addition to a general core covering the breadth of the computing discipline, students may focus on software engineering in globally distributed environments, computing applications for biotechnology and the life sciences, data mining/big data, and business applications.\nOur faculty maintain active publication records, with significant funding from government agencies (NSF, NIH, Department of Labor, etc.) and industry (Genentech, Microsoft, IBM, Arista Networks, Mozilla, etc.). Students actively engage in research projects, write papers, attend conferences, and participate in funding proposals. SF State’s Center for Computing for Life Sciences and several specialized laboratories provide research and project focus, as well as opportunities to collaborate with faculty and students from other SF State departments and industry. A new Entrepreneurship Program and Developers Prize supports the development of student projects into business or non-profit ventures.\nComputing Facilities\nCentral Facilities\nA network of Mac, Linux, and PC servers supported by SF State Information Technology Services\nA Linux server (unixlab) supported by SF State Information Technology Services, used for Computer Science courses\nWorkstation labs in the SF State J.

For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Anthropology\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts\nDean: Dr. Ifeoma Kiddoe Nwankwo\nDepartment of Anthropology\nFine Arts Building, Room 525\nPhone: (415) 338-2046\nWebsite:\nanthropology.sfsu.edu\nChair: Dr. Mark Griffin\nProgram Scope\nAnthropology at San Francisco State focuses on the study of humanity from archaeological, biological, cultural, and visual perspectives. Students are introduced to human populations past and present and explore how our field can advance efforts in social justice. Anthropologists document, investigate and seek to understand cultures of other times and places, and they also play important roles in social and political debate and advocacy.\nUndergraduate majors explore the theoretical foundations, topical foci, and ethical questions of the discipline, gain an appreciation for diversity in lifeways, and acquire an understanding of how anthropology can benefit communities and lead to social change. Our department creates opportunities for students to practice experiential learning and carry out hands-on field and laboratory research.\nThe Minor in Anthropology complements a broad range of majors in the life sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. You can complete the minor with courses in lower-division 5B, 3B, and 4; and upper-division physical/life science (5UD); arts and humanities(3UD) or social sciences (4 UD).\nCareer Outlook\nTraining in anthropology prepares students for a wide range of careers. Anthropology majors can gain an extremely wide range of skills – from osteological analysis to ethnographic research. Our graduates have gotten jobs in fields that include health and medical services, community organizing and advocacy, cultural resource management, museum research and education, urban planning, international economic development, environmental assessment, media, user experience (UX) research, market research, education, social work, investigative journalism, public policy, social services, early childhood education, and filmmaking.\nIf you’re wondering whether you can major in Anthropology and still pursue a career in law, medicine, research, teaching, or museum work – among many other possible fields – the answer is probably yes. For more insight into how Anthropology can prepare you for the careers that you find interesting, consult with faculty advisors.\nProfessor\nDouglass Bailey (2008),\nProfessor in Anthropology\n.

    "content": "Multiple Subject Credential Programs\nMultiple Subject Credential (MSC)\nThe Multiple Subject Credential Program (MSC) prepares candidates to teach in elementary school from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade. Our credential program provides MSC candidates with the pedagogical skills and content knowledge to support the social and academic development of all children. The MSC is grounded in culturally responsive pedagogy aligned with a social justice perspective. MSC candidates develop or advance the skills needed to support educational equity for all children. We offer several program pathways to obtain the Multiple Subject Preliminary Credential.\nTwelve units of the MSC can be applied to the following: Master of Arts: Concentration in Elementary Education or to the Master of Arts in Early Childhood Education. Students pursuing the Credential + MA must enroll in one of these two MA's concurrent with or within two years of completing MSC coursework.\nMultiple Subject Credential (MSC), Bilingual Authorization\nThe MSC, Bilingual Authorization allows bilingual-biliterate candidates to obtain an additional authorization to teach in a bilingual classroom setting from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade. Candidates must demonstrate listening, speaking, reading, and writing proficiency in the focus language (Cantonese, Mandarin, or Spanish).\nMSC Program Options\n1.\nThree-semester program\noffers either a daytime or evening option. Candidates are placed in learning communities that allow a cohort to enroll in sequenced coursework. Candidates are placed for student teaching in socially, economically, culturally, and linguistically diverse elementary classroom settings.\n2.\nOne-year, Summer Start Program\nis geared for full-time students who can immerse themselves in an intensive credential program. Students in this program are admitted beginning in the Summer term and continue into the Fall and Spring semester. Grounded in strong research-based practices and learning theories, the program provides candidates with opportunities to apply theories and instructional approaches in their student teaching practicum within weeks of starting the program. Some courses are organized in a module format allowing candidates to complete the program within one academic year. Subject Matter Competency & Basic Skills must be completed before the fall semester begins.\n3.\nInterns:\nThe California Commission on Teacher Credentialing provisional permit allows non-credentialed individuals to work as the teacher of record only if the teacher is enrolled in a credential program and meets other criteria. Hiring decisions are made entirely by the local school district.  If a candidate has an offer of employment and wishes to enroll in the intern program, the following conditions must be met:\na. A candidate must show evidence of completion of the Basic Skills requirement, Subject Matter Competency, and U.S. Constitution requirement;\nb. A school district must offer the candidate a teaching position at an elementary school site;\nc. A candidate must apply and be admitted to an accredited credential program;\nd. The candidate must complete 120 credit hours of credential coursework (equivalent to three 3-unit classes)\nOnce these conditions are met, the candidate must submit an application for the intern teaching permit to the Department of Elementary Education Intern Coordinator, who will review for approvals.  The Graduate College of Education Credential Analyst will then authorize the permit.\n*Note: Interns work at a slower coursework pace while in the credential program to permit full time employment\n4.\nBilingual Educators for Social Transformation (BEST) Spanish/English\n(Three semesters)\nBEST embraces concepts of social justice and equity with a focused philosophical stance representing critical pedagogy and rooted in bilingual education. BEST integrates culturally relevant pedagogy throughout coursework. The goals are to develop critical educators who are equipped with tools to analyze and develop agency about challenges Latinos have faced, while also recognizing and highlighting the successes of the Latino communities.  Candidates who complete this program receive the Multiple Subject Credential with a Bilingual Authorization in Spanish.\n5.\nChinese Bilingual Authorization\n(Three Semesters)\nThis option provides bilingual-bicultural courses in Chinese literacy and student teaching placement in Chinese bilingual classrooms. Students who complete this program receive the Multiple Subject Credential Program with a Bilingual Authorization in either Manadarin or Cantonese.\n*Note: International students are required to be admitted into a degree program and cannot be classified as credential only.  International students interested in obtaining the Multiple Subject Credential Program must apply and be admitted to the Master of Arts Program in Education: Concentration in Elementary Education + Credential.\n6.\nEarly Childhood Education Focus, Transitional Kindergarten to Third grade.\n(One academic year) Fall admissions.\nThis option provides an ECE focus, TK to third grade. However, the MS Credential qualifies candidates to teach TK to fifth grade. It is grounded in culturally responsive pedagogy. Students enroll in sequenced courses addressing children's language and academic and social development in primary classroom settings. Several courses will have modules focusing on instructional approaches for grades 4-5.\nEducative Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA)\nAll Multiple Subject credential candidates are required to pass the Educative Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) during the final student teaching phase to earn the California Multiple Subject Credential. The edTPA provides teacher preparation programs with a systemic approach to evaluate a candidate's competencies with the Teaching Performance Expectations. EED 758, the final student teaching practicum seminar, supports candidates in completing the edTPA.\nGPA Requirement for the Multiple Subject Credential Program\nA GPA of 3.0 or better with no grade lower than a C is required in all courses comprising the professional education sequence.

For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in German\nThe academic program leading to a B.A. in German offers a wide range of courses to meet the diverse needs of today's student population. The undergraduate curriculum includes coursework in language, literature, linguistics, and culture. In addition, students can select courses in translation and German for business. To ensure that all students develop advanced language competency, the German program places great importance on small-sized participatory classes, which maximize opportunities to communicate in German.\nInnovative teaching methods, films, multimedia, and online materials enhance classroom interaction and enrich the academic experience. In addition, excellent computer facilities and a Foreign Language Multimedia Lab provide support for our academic program.\nThe German major consists of a total of 44 units, including 30 units of upper-division coursework. Up to 14 units of prerequisite coursework or demonstrated language proficiency is required to begin the major.\nStudents may receive credit towards the lower-division requirements for the major with the appropriate scores on Advanced Placement Exams.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the Bachelor of Arts in German the student will:\nDemonstrate listening comprehension at the advanced level. Understand the utterances of native speakers and extract main ideas from recordings of authentic speech, including excerpts from lectures, films, radio, and television broadcasts.\nDemonstrate reading proficiency at the advanced level: Understand and summarize main ideas in target language texts intended for general readers, including social correspondences, general purpose essays, short stories, and news writing.\nDemonstrate speaking proficiency at the advanced level: Sustain a conversation on a general topic with a fluent speaker of the target language, narrate, and describe on a variety of topics at paragraph length, and respond to spontaneous developments in an exchange.\nDemonstrate writing proficiency at the advanced level: Produce narratives and descriptions, cohesive summaries, and routine social correspondences (e.g. business letters, resumes), demonstrating awareness of diction, syntax, and stylistics in the writing process.\nDemonstrate cultural knowledge: Understanding of cultural values, folk beliefs, social conventions and festive celebrations unique to target culture. Identify and characterize exemplars of painting, architecture, music, film, and other fine arts in the target culture. Identify major historical events and order them chronologically.\nGerman (B.A.)\n— 42 units\nRequired Courses (24 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nGER 101\nFirst Semester German\n3\nGER 102\nSecond Semester German\n3\nGER 206\nIntermediate German Conversation\n3\nGER 207\nIntermediate German\n3\nGER 305\nAdvanced Grammar and Composition\n3\nSelect One:\n3\nGER 330\nExploring the German Language\nMLL 325\nLinguistics for Foreign Languages\nGER 535\nThe German Novella of the 19th and 20th Centuries\n3\nMLL 400GW\nReading and Analysis of Cultural Texts - GWAR\n3\nUpper-Division Electives (18 units)\nAny upper-division course (GER 300+) can be counted as an elective.\nNote:\nA minimum of 30 upper-division units must be completed for the degree (including upper-division units required for the major, general education, electives, etc.). A student can complete this major yet not attain the necessary number of upper-division units required for graduation. In this case, additional upper-division courses will be needed to reach the required total.\nStudy Abroad\nStudents are encouraged to study abroad through the International Programs of the California State University. For students opting to study abroad, all study abroad units will count as units in residence and can be used for graduation credit. Up to 31 units required for the major may be taken through the CSU International Program in Germany. These units must be approved by a German advisor. A minimum of 9 upper-division units (GER 300+) must be taken at the home campus at SFSU.\nComplementary Studies\nRequired of all candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree in German are 12 units of Complementary Studies, which must come from courses bearing a prefix other than GER, and not cross-listed with GER. Complementary Studies for the German major can be satisfied via four possible routes:\n12 units in any foreign language other than German (may include up to 3 units of MLL prefix courses);\n12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (including CSU Study Abroad and SF State Bilateral);\n12 units of coursework taken as partial completion of a second major, a minor or a certificate;\n12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of a German Program advisor.\nRelated disciplines typically include linguistics, literature, communication, Jewish studies, philosophy, history, humanities, education, and any aspect of Europe.\nWhere a course with a non-GER prefix, (and not cross-listed with GER), is taken as a core requirement or elective for the German major, the said course may also (double) count towards Complementary Studies only via the Study Abroad option or the 2nd Major/Minor/Certificate option listed above. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Foreign Language option are allowed a maximum of 3 units of overlap of MLL-prefix courses between German major and Complementary Studies units.\nStudents satisfying Complementary Studies through the Related Subjects option are not allowed to double-count major and Complementary Studies units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor.

Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "title": "Master of Arts in Spanish | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Master of Arts in Spanish\nThe M.A. program in Spanish is mostly focused on Spanish and Latin American literature and culture from the Middle Ages to the present. Over the course of their graduate studies in Spanish, students acquire a solid grounding in major works of poetry, prose, and theater, as well as the tools necessary to approach these works critically. All courses in the Spanish program are taught in Spanish. For more information, please see the graduate program website at\nhttps://spanish.sfsu.edu/spanish\n.\nAdmission to the Program\nIn addition to the requirements established by the University and the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures, a student must also meet the following admission requirements established by the Spanish M.A. Program.\nAll applicants are expected to have the equivalent of a B.A. in Spanish, that is, 30 units of upper division work in Spanish, with a GPA of 3.0 or better. If the student has not met this requirement, he or she may, at the discretion of the Program, be admitted as a “conditionally classified” graduate student. Students thus admitted must satisfactorily complete a number of specified courses before they become fully classified. These courses are not included in the 30 units required for the Masters.\nApplicants must arrange for two letters of recommendation to be sent to the program.\nApplicants must demonstrate to the Spanish faculty a record of prior scholastic achievement indicative of potential success as a graduate student. This means that applicants must submit a brief writing sample (essay) in Spanish or English which shows the scope of the applicant’s critical preparation and analytical ability. Ideally, this will be a\n1,000 to 1,200 word\npaper written in an undergraduate class.\nApplicants must also submit two copies of a brief statement of purpose (500 words), one written in English, the other in Spanish.\nApplicants are responsible for meeting the appropriate deadlines. Materials sent directly to the Spanish Program must be postmarked by April 1 to be considered for fall admission, or by October 1 to be considered for spring admission.\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nThe University has a requirement for written English proficiency that is to be assessed at two different levels.\nLevel One\nStudent admitted into each program must demonstrate, prior to the start of coursework, the ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues.\nLevel Two\nUpon completion of each program, candidates must demonstrate an improved ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues commensurate with the academic training received within the program.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nProficiency in Written English (Entry Level)\nStudent admitted into each program must demonstrate, prior to the start of coursework, the ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues.\nProficiency in Written English (Exit Level)\nUpon completion of each program, candidates must demonstrate an improved ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues commensurate with the academic training received within the program.\nUse of Appropriate Resources, Materials and Format for Writing a Research Paper\nStudents must demonstrate the ability to produce effective academic writing based on scholarly research.\nKnowledge of Culture, Language and Literature at the Advanced Level\nDemonstrate graduate-level competence in the concentration language.\nAnalyze texts for theme, structure, style and other aspects of prose and poetry.\nExplain how literary movements influence each other and are shaped by history.\nDemonstrate interdisciplinary approaches when analyzing complex problems and intellectual questions.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the present day structure of the concentration language,\nincluding the phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and discourse features.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the historical development and sociolinguistic variations of the\nconcentration language.\nDemonstrate the ability to develop basic skills as teacher-researcher while applying theoretical knowledge to practice, and to implement standard-based Second Language Acquisition (SLA) instruction.\nSpanish (M.A.)\n— Minimum 30 Units\nGraduate Courses (15 units)\nGraduate courses in Spanish (700-800 level)\nUpper-Division/Graduate Courses (6 units)\nCourses numbers 500 to 899.\nElective Courses (6 units)\nCulminating Experience (3 units)\nSelect one:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nSPAN 896EXM\n&\nSPAN 899\nCulminating Experience Examination\nand Independent Study\n3\nSPAN 898\nMaster's Thesis\n3\nAt least five courses (15 units) must be graduate courses taken within the Spanish program. The balance of the units counted for the degree may include up to nine units of upper-division courses, graduate courses from other programs in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures, and a maximum of six units from a related field outside the department. Any courses taken outside the Spanish Program must have prior approval of the Graduate Advisor.\nWritten English Proficiency\nSince the Master’s Comprehensive Written and Oral Examinations are in Spanish, students must fulfill the Level-Two English requirement by passing\nMLL 701\nwith a B or higher. Students who do not receive at least a B must retake the course.\nCulminating Experience\nThe semester prior to taking the exams or submitting the thesis, students must have a pre-qualifying screening interview. This interview serves to assess the student's preparation. The committee is made up of three professors, at least two of whom must be members of the Spanish Program. After the screening interview, upon recommendation by the committee, the student passes to the next stage of the culminating experience.\nThere are two options for the culminating experience: OPTION A) After the screening interview, the candidate may request a copy of the questions for the written exam. Exam questions will be drawn from the list given to the candidate. The candidate will have a semester to prepare for the comprehensive exams. OPTION B) The candidate submits a three-page thesis proposal, an exhaustive bibliography (around 30 books and journal articles), and a brief outline. The candidate will then have six months to complete the thesis.\nFor OPTION A, comprehensive written exams are given twice annually generally at the end of November/April or the first week of May/December. The exam is given over two days and takes a total of five hours: three hours the first day and two hours the next. Students who pass the written exams will sit for their oral exam the following week. The oral exam takes one hour. For OPTION B, after completion of the thesis, the thesis defense takes one hour.\nFor more information, please see the program website at\nhttp://spanish.sfsu.edu\n.",

Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor. For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with an AA-T in\nEnglish\nENGL ADT Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in English\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major.

This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science\nThe Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science is designed for students intending to prepare for graduate school or direct entry into a career as an environmental scientist or environmental manager in industry or government. Entry to the major presupposes prior coursework comprising the high school equivalents of two years of algebra, one year of plane geometry, one-half year of trigonometry, one year of biology, and one year of physics and/or chemistry.\nThe Environmental Science curriculum comprises a core providing a foundation of science and methods courses—introductory earth systems and environmental science, biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics—as well as distributed electives in environmental science, environmental management, and analytical methods, and a capstone proseminar.\nENV 205\nprovides introductory research design, statistical and geospatial methods. Geospatial methods are then further developed in\nGEOG 603\n, which is a prerequisite for all advanced GIS classes. The GWAR course (\nENV 500GW\n) focuses on the physical and human dimensions of climate change, providing a rich source of topics for composition at the upper-division level.\nStudent progress toward the degree is aided in that some of these core classes also meet lower-division general education requirements. Students will complete both GE Area 2 (Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning) and GE Area 5 (Physical and Biological Sciences) in\nGEOG 101\nor\nERTH 112\n(Area 5A Physical Science),\nGEOG 160\n(Area 5B Biological Science and Area 5C Laboratory), and\nMATH 226\n(Area 2).\nElectives are distributed into three areas:\nEnvironmental Systems, including investigations of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, pedosphere (soils), environmental chemistry, and the biosphere;\nEnvironmental Management of managed lands and waters, natural resources, threatened species and livable environment; and\nAnalytical Methods, including geographic information science, statistical analysis, and field-based environmental analysis methods.\nThrough choices in each area, students can tailor their program in a variety of ways, to focus on water, soils and agriculture, biotic systems, restoration science, coastal systems, bioclimatology, pollution management, protected land management, water resources management, or others. The capstone course,\nENV 690\n, prepares students for careers and graduate study.\nStudents are advised that the CR grade is acceptable in any two courses to be counted for the major. No more than one course counted toward major requirements may be completed with a grade less than a C–.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will investigate environmental systems from an interdisciplinary perspective including interactions between systems and interactions with human activities.\nStudents will critically evaluate environmental plans, and strategies as well as resource management practices with respect to environmental sustainability and social justice.\nStudents will utilize GIScience techniques to investigate environmental questions.\nStudents will conduct field based sampling and/or observational studies, analyze results and critically evaluate the method.\nStudents will design, conduct and report on independent research projects using appropriate and well-developed methods.\nEnvironmental Science (B.S.)\n– 65 units minimum\nLower-Division Requirements (27-28 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nSelect One:\n3\nBIOL 150\nThe World of Plants\nBIOL 170\nAnimal Diversity\nBIOL 313\nPrinciples of Ecology\nCHEM 180\nChemistry for Energy and the Environment\n3\nSelect One:\n3-4\nERTH 112\nOur Dynamic Earth Lecture and Lab\nGEOG 101\nOur Physical Environment\nSelect One:\n3\nENVS 130\nEnvironmental Studies\nGEOG 102\nThe Human Environment\nENV 205\nOur Environment Through Data\n3\nGEOG 160\nIntroduction to Environmental Science\n4\nMATH 226\nCalculus I\n4\nSelect One:\n4\nPHYS 111\n&\nPHYS 112\nGeneral Physics I\nand General Physics I Laboratory\nPHYS 220\n&\nPHYS 222\nGeneral Physics with Calculus I\nand General Physics with Calculus I Laboratory\nUpper-Division Requirements (6 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENV 500GW\nPhysical and Human Dimensions of Climate Change - GWAR\n3\nGEOG 603\nIntroduction to Geographic Information Systems\n3\nCapstone (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENV 690\nCapstone Seminar\n3\nElectives (29-32 units)\nDistributed between Environmental Systems, Environmental Management, and Analytical Methods:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nEnvironmental Systems\n11-12\nSelect 11-12 units:\nAllows for one 3-unit course\nCHEM 380\nChemistry Behind Environmental Pollution\n3\nSelect One:\n3-4\nERTH 400\nAtmosphere and Oceans in the Earth System\nGEOG 313\nEarth's Climate System\nERTH 410\nEarthquakes and Volcanoes\n3\nSelect One:\n4\nERTH 425\nGeomorphology\nGEOG 312\nGeography of Landforms\nERTH 500\nEarth and Life Through Time\n3\nERTH 515\nSedimentary Materials and Environments\n4\nERTH 535\nPlanetary Climate Change\n4\nGEOG 314\nBioclimatology\n4\nGEOG 316\nBiogeography\n4\nGEOG 317\nSoils\n4\nGEOG 342/ERTH 442\nSurface Water Hydrology\n4\nGEOG 644\nWater Quality\n3\nEnvironmental Management\n11-12\nSelect 11-12 units:\nAllows for one 3-unit course\nGEOG 421\nFuture Environments\n3\nGEOG 427\nAgriculture and Food Supply\n4\nGEOG/ERTH 642\nWatershed Assessment and Restoration\n4\nGEOG 647\nGeography of Water Resources\n4\nGEOG 648\nManagement of National Parks and Protected Areas\n4\nGEOG/USP 652\nEnvironmental Impact Analysis\n4\nGEOG/ENVS 657\nNatural Resource Management: Biotic Resources\n4\nGEOG 666\nGeography of Garbage: Recycling and Waste Reduction\n3\nAnalytical Methods\n7-8\nSelect 2 courses:\nBIOL 458\nBiometry\n4\nGEOG 602\nField Methods in Environmental Science & Physical Geography\n4\nGEOG 604\nEnvironmental Data Science\n3\nGEOG 610\nRemote Sensing of the Environment I\n4\nGEOG 611\nRemote Sensing of the Environment II\n4\nGEOG 620\nGeographical Information Systems\n4\nGEOG 621\nGeographic Information Systems for Environmental Analysis\n4\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor.

    "content": "Minor in Philosophy\nThe department welcomes students from other majors or programs who wish to examine their personal philosophy, investigate the philosophies of others, or sharpen their skills as independent thinkers. The enterprise of philosophy develops a wide array of skills necessary for clarifying premises, uncovering presuppositions (one's own and those of others), weighing the pros and cons of conflicting values, and analyzing concepts and issues. Courses in philosophy serve to develop and enhance these skills. Some courses concentrate on specific philosophical issues. Others provide an overview of an entire area of human inquiry or endeavor (such as the sciences, the arts, political theory and law, medicine, social justice, and how our minds, senses, and emotions work) or of the philosophical foundations that characterize a historical period.\nA great number of the courses offered are not only appropriate as part of a philosophy major but are of special interest to students in other fields. These courses are designed to help students understand the theoretical frameworks, methodological presuppositions, and more abstract dimensions of the paramount areas of knowledge.\nEach student minoring in philosophy must take at least 15 units in philosophy, at least 12 of these being upper-division units.\nThe flexibility of the philosophy minor and the wide array of philosophy courses allows students to choose a course of study that best suits their interests and complements their major program. Students interested in either the philosophical understanding of a field of knowledge or in philosophy for self-understanding should feel free to consult the department chairperson or an advisor on appropriate courses.\nAll coursework used to satisfy the requirements of the minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nGain knowledge of the history or current state of the discipline of philosophy.\nDevelop a grasp of representative philosophical issues and ways of dealing with them.\nDevelop a capacity to apply philosophical methods to intellectual problems.\nMinor in Philosophy - 15 units minimum\nEach student minoring in philosophy must take at least 15 units in philosophy, at least 12 of these being upper-division units.\nAll coursework used to satisfy the requirements of the minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0.",

For this option, six units must be from classes in a non-literary related field.\nDepending on the concentration within the major, CS pathway, and with the approval of a departmental advisor, up to 12 units from courses with non-ENG prefixes that count towards the Complementary Studies requirement may also count as English electives in fulfillment of major requirements.\nStudents who have earned AA-T or AS-T degrees and are pursuing a similar B.A. degree at SF State are required to fulfill the Complementary Studies requirement as defined by the major department. Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\n4\nConsider taking a class combined with a laboratory or a separate lab to fulfill 5C if not already satisfied.\n5\nFirst-time freshmen must take one lower-division Area 4 course that meets US History (USH).\n6\nMajor Electives (9 units)\nThree courses selected with the approval of an advisor.",

The program is designed to bring together a wide range of areas, including Arab, Middle East, and Global Studies, race and ethnic studies, and critical cultural studies. Curricular focus areas include history, identity, politics, pop culture, literature, art, creativity, activism, gender, sexuality, race, immigration and citizenship, and comparative studies with other communities. AMED provides students with a non-traditional perspective on national and transnational positioning and resistances of Arab and Muslim communities.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nLearn how to apply a justice-centered analysis to the experiences of Arab and Muslim communities.\nIdentify the socio-political contexts that Arab and Muslim communities have faced.\nIdentify how structural inequalities, such as those of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, citizenship, age, and ability, impact Arab and Muslim communities.\nMinor in Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas Studies - 15 units\nOnly one-third of the units, or no more than two courses, can be taken on the basis of credit/no credit.\nA minimum of 6 upper-division units are required to complete the minor.\nAll coursework used to satisfy the requirements of the minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0.\nWritten declaration of the pursuit of the minor is not necessary prior to enrollment in any of its required or elective courses.\nRequired Core Courses (6 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nRRS 101\nIntroduction to Arab and Muslim Communities\n3\nRRS 255\nVoices in Exile: Arab and Muslim American and Civil Liberties post-9/11/2001\n3\nElectives (9 units)\nMust select one course (3 units) from each section; two courses (6 units) must be upper-division of 300 or above.

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nEarly Childhood Studies (Care and Education) BA + Early Childhood Special Education Credential + Special Education MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in Early Childhood Education\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in Art: Concentration in Art History and Studio Art\nThe\nBachelor\nof\nArts\nin\nArt:\nConcentration\nin\nArt\nHistory\nand\nStudio\nArt\nprovides students with interdisciplinary experience and skills in art history and studio art practice (ceramics, digital media & emerging technology, painting and drawing, printmaking, photography, sculpture, and textiles). Students take classes in Art History to develop skills in writing, research, and knowledge of the histories and institutions of art in a global context, and apply these skills to diverse areas of studio art production in order to acquire a broad background in various mediums and techniques.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Art (Concentration in Art History and Studio Art) Program Learning Outcomes are guided by core values that inform both studio art practice and art history. Upon graduation, students will be able to:\nUtilize diverse knowledge of studio and art historical practices integrating appropriate techniques, media, and processes to create artistic form with research, writing, and analysis.\nGain breadth of knowledge of art history globally: identify major artists, works, movements; define key terms, concepts, and theories; and understand diverse historical, social, political, cultural, and ideological perspectives.\nDemonstrate skills in critical thinking, formal analysis, and visual literacy to interpret and evaluate the meaning of art and visual culture.\nApply processes of experimentation (revision, refinement, critical reflection on successes and failures) to develop curiosity and imagination and self-directed research to create portfolios of artwork and/or writing.\nUnderstand the ethical dimension of artistic practice and scholarship within a global context and in relationship to the dynamics of power—including those of class, gender, race, and geopolitics—as expressed through visual, spatial, institutional, and ideological practices.\nSteps to Change Major\nJuniors or seniors who have declared another major, but wish to change their major to Art with a concentration in Art History and Studio Art must attend a major group advising session. Email\nsch_art@sfsu.edu\nfor information and advising session dates.\nFor students transferring from other institutions, a minimum of 12 units in residence is required.\nStudents should be aware that art practice is time-consuming and expensive. Instructional Materials Fees are required for most studio courses, and students may find themselves spending additional sums of money on their projects.\nStudio practice courses require hands-on practice and experience; this limits the number of students who can enroll in such courses.\nAdvising\nStudents are strongly encouraged to consult with a major advisor on a regular basis as they advance through the program. A list of departmental advisors and contact information can be found on the school’s website:\nhttps://art.sfsu.edu/advising\n.\nStudents are also advised to consult with the University’s Advising Center for information about General Education and other University requirements, as well as the Advising Resource Center in the College of Liberal & Creative Arts:\nhttp://lca.sfsu.edu/students#arc\n.\nJump to\nLower-Division Courses (12 units)\nUpper-Division Art History (12 units)\nUpper-Division Studio Art (12 units)\nGraduate Writing Assessment Requirement (3 units)\nArt Productions (1 unit)\nCapstone (3 units)\nGeneral Education Requirements\nBachelor of Arts in Art: Concentration in Art History and Studio Art\n— 43 units\nLower-Division Courses (12 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nArt History\n6\nSelect Two:\nARTH 201\nGlobal Art History I\n3\nARTH 202\nGlobal Art History II\n3\nARTH/HUM 205\nAsian Art History\n3\nStudio Art\n6\nSelect Two:\nART 210\nIntroduction to Digital Media Arts\n3\nART 222\nIntroduction to Textile Art\n3\nART 231\nIntroduction to Drawing\n3\nART 235\nIntroduction to Printmaking\n3\nART 240\nIntroduction to Contemporary Sculpture\n3\nART 245\nIntroduction to Ceramics\n3\nART 260\nIntroduction to the Darkroom\n3\nBefore advancing to the 300-level or higher courses or declaring a concentration, all majors must have completed the University’s lower-division requirements and the lower-division courses for the major, or equivalent.

For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with an AA-T in\nStudio Arts\nor\nArt History\n.\nARTS or ARTH ADT Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in Art History or  Studio Arts\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",
