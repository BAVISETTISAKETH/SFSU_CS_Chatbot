A space survey is performed in partnership with Capital Planning, Design & Construction (CPDC) and the College / Department space contacts.\nThe following are the space survey guidelines to help you through the process.  Read each item carefully an keep in mind the need for accuracy throughout your college/department survey:\nReport all assigned space as actually being used and edit on provided SFDB report or excel spreadsheet.\nWalk-thru all assigned space (in all buildings) to physically verify each room's current actual usage and other space information as shown on SFDB survey report.\nConfirm that room numbers listed on provided SFDB reports are the actual room numbers for the space.\nCarefully assess all space report details, such as: TB (time base), WS (workstations), TCH LAB (teaching lab), etc.\nThe survey you submit back to OSM is integral to the ongoing inventory process of all academic space.\nOSM performs space audits on an as needed basis.\nAt the completion of the space survey process, OSM in collaboration with CPDC and other Academic Affairs units updates the FIS and SFDB. Depending on the scope of changes, a follow-up meeting between OSM, College / Dept. contact, and the AVP of Academic Resources may be scheduled.",

The table lists pairs of class meetings that have final exam conflicts for students enrolled in each combination.\nNote to Students:\nPlease review your schedule for final exam conflicts and consult with your instructor(s) during the first class period.\nFinal Exam Conflict, Example 1\nA student is enrolled in ACCT 101 and CHEM 102. ACCT 101 meets MWF 8:00am-9:00am and CHEM 102 meets M 9:30am-12:15pm, so these classes have overlapping final exam times. This also applies if ACCT 101 meets MW 8:00am-9:15am and CHEM 102 meets M 9:30am-12:15pm.\nFinal Exam Conflict, Example 2\nA student is enrolled in ENG 214 and BIOL 101. ENG 214 meets TR 12:30pm-1:45pm and BIOL 101 meets R 9:30am-12:15pm, so these classes have overlapping final exam times.\nNote to Students: Please review your schedule for final exam conflicts and consult with your instructor(s) during the first class period.\nFirst Class Enrolled by Start Time\nSecond Class Enrolled Meeting\n8:00am MWF/MW/daily\nM 9:30am-12:15pm\n11:00am MWF/MW/daily\nM 12:30pm-3:15pm\n12:30pm MW\nW 9:30am-12:15pm\n12:30pm TR\nR 9:30am-12:15pm\n1:00pm MWF/MW/daily\nF 9:30am-12:15pm\n3:30pm MW\nW 12:30pm-3:15pm\n3:30pm TR\nR 12:30pm-3:15pm\n4:00pm MWF/MW/daily\nF 12:30pm-3:15pm\n4:00pm TR\nR 12:30pm-3:15pm\n5:00pm MWF/MW\nM 6:00pm-8:45pm\n6:30pm MW\nW 3:30pm-6:15pm\n6:30pm TR\nR 3:30pm-6:15pm\n8:00pm MWF/MW\nW 4:30pm-7:15pm\n8:00pm MWF/MW\nW 5:00pm-7:45pm\n8:00pm TR\nT 4:30pm-7:15pm\n8:00pm TR\nT 5:00pm-7:45pm\nNotes: M = Monday, T = Tuesday, W = Wednesday, R = Thursday, F = Friday, daily = Monday through Friday",
