    "title": "Third-Party Billing | San Francisco State University | College of Professional & Global Education",
    "content": "Third-Party Billing\nThird-party sponsors are organizations, employers, agencies or departments that agree to cover student(s) tuition. Some common examples of sponsors are private and public organizations and government agencies (Department of Rehabilitation, Veteran Affairs, WIOA, etc.).\nNote: Contact the\nOffice of Student Financial Aid\nwith any questions about your financial aid.\nWho Qualifies for Third-Party Payments?\nA student needs to obtain a written letter, also known as an Authorization to Bill (ATB) Letter, from the sponsor specifying how much of the tuition they will cover and for which semester(s). Students receiving confirmation must submit this letter of authorization to\nsubsidy@sfsu.edu\nin order for the sponsor to be properly invoiced. Please retain a copy of the authorization for your records.\nNote: Contact the\nOffice of Student Financial Aid\nwith any questions about your financial aid.\nAuthorization to Bill (ATB) Letter\nThe terms of the ATB letter agreement must be defined in an official document from the sponsor. The letter should include:\nSponsor’s official letterhead\nStudent’s legal first and last name\nStudent’s SFSU ID number\nCovered semester(s), with indication if covering multiple terms\nProgram or course details covered by the agency\nAuthorized billing amount\nContact person details (name, address, phone number)\nSponsor’s signature\nThe College of Professional & Global Education does not invoice for lab or material fees. Students are responsible for these fees if the third-party contract (TPC) agency does not pay them directly.\nThird-Party Billing Process\nTo avoid being dropped from your classes, your ATB must be received at least two weeks before your class begins, which is the payment due date. This allows time to apply the service indicator to your account that protects your enrollment. This indicator will prevent you from being dropped from the covered course(s) indicated on the ATB. Application of this indicator will also postpone the payment deadline to a later date. The deferment does not mean that the University has received a payment.\nInvoices will be processed after census has passed for a given semester. The sponsor has 30 days after receipt of invoice to satisfy the balance. Refer to the\nCalendar and Deadlines\nfor important dates.\nNote:\nStudents are ultimately responsible for any outstanding charges not covered by or defaulted by the sponsor. Nonpayment will result in a hold on the student’s account which will prevent future registration.\nVeteran Benefits\nIf you are a student receiving VA benefits, contact SFSU's Veterans Services office for further assistance.\nOffice Hours\nOneStop:\nMonday to Friday 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nPhone:\nMonday to Friday 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nEmail:\nveterans@sfsu.edu\nTelephone:\n(415) 338-2336\nLocation:\nStudent Services Building - OneStop Window #6\n1600 Holloway Avenue\nSan Francisco, CA 94132\nFor more information, please visit the\nVeteran Services\nweb page.\nRefunds\nSee\nDrops and Refunds | Subsidy Refunds\n.\nQuestions?\nQuestions about Third-Party Billing?\nEmail\nsubsidy@sfsu.edu\nNot sure who your program administrator is?\nPlease refer to our\nProgram Directory\nfor contact information.\nDocument Readers\nare required to view documents.",

    "content": "About the College of Professional & Global Education\nSan Francisco State University's College of Professional & Global Education (CPaGE) (formerly College of Extended Learning) offers a wide variety of continuing adult education\ncourses\nand programs to prepare you for career advancement, career change or personal growth. We offer weekend, evening and\nonline courses,\nonline degree completion\n,\ninternational education\nand access to thousands of transferable\ndegree-credit University classes\n.\nPrograms and Courses\nStrategic Plan\nBy the Numbers\n4,700+\nStudents\n60+\nPrograms\n35+\nCertificates\nLocations\nMost in-person classes are held at one of two locations in San Francisco: 1600 Holloway Avenue at 19th Avenue and 160 Spear Street, 5th Floor.\nWe also offer courses at the\nSierra Nevada Field Campus\nand the College of San Mateo.\nStudents and Faculty\nCollege of Professional & Global Education students are degree-seeking SFSU students, working professionals, students who have completed their formal education, students wanting to take a program that is not offered as a degree and the general public. The college offers academic units, continuing education units, online classes and noncredit courses. Some programs are also available for students who want to complete bachelor's degrees, advanced academic degrees and certificates.\nThe College of Professional & Global Education taps a combination of SFSU faculty and expert practitioners from the community to teach our courses. Because we can offer programs to meet the demands of the marketplace, we have the capacity to create and deliver opportunities for learning that are high quality, reasonably priced and accessible to a broad segment of the larger community.\nWhat Students Say\n“I had the pleasure of studying International Business abroad at SFSU, fall and spring of 2020. I was welcomed warmly with open arms from the Center for Global Engagement staff and wider network and never looked back…”\nEmma Creighton\nStudent from New Zealand\nInternational Business\n\"I moved from Argentina to San Francisco in 1998. Since I have always worked in the legal field I decided to apply my experience here in the U.S.\nMy knowledge of American law was very limited, and I did not want to go to law school. I researched and found the Paralegal Studies program at San Francisco State University and discovered that it had everything that I was looking for at a reasonable price.\nThe classes were excellent and the teachers were very knowledgeable. My English was not very good at the beginning of the program, so in addition to my work and classes, I spent several hours every week doing my homework and preparing presentations.\nIt took me a year and a half to complete the program, and on the same day that I graduated I was offered a paralegal position at Baker & McKenzie, where I worked from 2000 to 2007.\nIn 2007 I came to Google, where I'm still working as an international corporate paralegal applying everything I learned in the Paralegal Studies program at San Francisco State University. I have always wanted to work in international law, so the fact that I can speak a second language (in my case Spanish) helped me to market myself and find a job in that field.\nOne of the most valuable things that I am still enjoying from the Program is the friendship that I developed with several of my classmates. We get together every couple of months to catch up with our lives and to exchange experiences in our respective offices. Also, it's a great networking tool that has helped several of us to find jobs.\"\nMariano Curat\nGraduate\nParalegal Studies\nCenter for Global Engagement\nThe Center for Global Engagement provides international students and professional groups unparalleled access to pursue rigorous academic education, cutting-edge professional development and enriching cultural exploration at an American university.

One CEU is earned for 10 hours of instruction.\nNoncredit Courses\nNoncredit courses serve professional, personal, and recreational needs. No units of measurement (academic credit or CEUs) are awarded for participation in noncredit courses.\nCourse Credit on Transcripts\nAcademic credit is listed on SFSU transcripts under units earned. CEU credit is listed in the title of the course; it is not listed under units earned.
