All exchange students come to SF State on university-sponsored J-1 visas.\nThe\nExchange Visitor Program\n(EVP) was created by the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. The EVP exists to promote cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the United States and countries around the world. The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) at the U.S. Department of State regulates this program. SF State's exchange program allows exchange students from all over the world the chance to study for one or two semesters in the United States.\nParticipation in the exchange program includes:\nComprehensive support from a dedicated exchange student advisor\nA priority registration period to ensure the best access to SF State classes possible\nA 3-day orientation before the beginning of classes\nIntercultural engagement opportunities through the International Education Exchange Council\nStudent perks such as gym access, tutoring, health services, and transportation discounts\nSee the links below to learn more about exchange program eligibility and application requirements.\n*If a student's university is not an Exchange Program Partner, they are not eligible for the exchange program. However, students are welcome to apply to SF State as a degree-seeking student.\nEligibility\nIn order to participate in San Francisco State University's Exchange Student Program, students must be eligible. Prospective exchange students should first contact the Exchange / International office at their home university.\nExchange Student Program Eligibility\nHow to Apply\nExchange students apply first at their home university, and if they are successful, are then invited to apply directly to SF State as an Exchange Student.  Click the link below to learn more about how to apply to be an Exchange Student at SF State.\nApplication Process\nInternational Education Exchange Council (IEEC)\nIEEC is an official student organization that encourages connections between international and domestic students.  All Exchange Students are required to participate in IEEC.\nIEEC at SF State\nLast updated:\nMarch 2024\nTo view PDF files, you'll need Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or above to view it.

    "content": "Collaboration with Overseas Institutions\nSan Francisco State University (SFSU) is currently focused on strategically expanding participation in exchange programs for our students, as we have more partnerships than students to participate. Therefore, we are holding off on expanding our exchange programs.\nWhen we are able to slowly explore new partnerships, we seek institutions whose priorities align with our goals for sustainable and impactful student mobility. Key criteria for potential partnerships include:\nStrong academic alignment (with sufficient coursework for SFSU students to participate for a year and make degree progress) in disciplines targeted for growth, such as speech pathology and public health\nA demonstrated ability to support balanced, sustainable inbound and outbound exchange\nComprehensive student support services, either through the international office or other campus service units\nLocations that broaden the geographic diversity of our outbound mobility offerings\nA recognized reputation for excellence and innovation in international education, with a sustained commitment to exchange\nA shared dedication to the values of diversity, equity, and social justice as core to the institutional mission\nPlease direct all inquires about establishing a new exchange program to Dr. Janelle Waldrep (\nwaldrep@sfsu.edu\n).\nAdditional information on SF State's guideline and protocol on establishing an international partnership is coming soon!",

    "content": "Returning Home\nWelcome back!\nWe cannot wait to hear your stories. As you return, we have gathered a few resources to help you.\nWork with your academic advisors about any courses previously not sign off (information below)\nReconnect with SF State Abroad (IEEC, AU 694, Global Ambassadors, and more) while you readjust to life in the US (details below)\nConnect with us on\nLinkedIn\nWrite about your experience and photos with\nSF State Abroad\nAdd study abroad to your resume, LinkedIn, and\nHandshake\nAcademics:\nSF State Transcript (Exchange Programs)\nSF State Transcript (CSU IP Programs)\nSF State Degree Progress Report\nPlease allow a semester for your study abroad work to appear on your unofficial transcript in Gateway. Your transcript will be sent from the partner abroad to the SF State Abroad Office. Your SF State Abroad advisor will process it before sending it to SF State's Registrar's Office. Once it is sent there, it takes 6-8 weeks before you will see anything on your unofficial transcript in Gateway. The timeframe varies as it depends upon when the SF State Abroad Office receives the transcript from abroad.\nPlease allow at least a semester for your CSU IP work to appear on your unofficial transcript in Gateway. Your transcript will be sent from the partner abroad to the Chancellor's Office. CSU IP will process it and post your transcript in your CSU IP portal before sending it directly to SF State's Registrar's Office. Once it is sent there, it takes 6-8 weeks before you will see anything on your unofficial transcript in Gateway.\nYour SF State Abroad advisors are happy to answer questions, but our office does not receive or process CSU IP study abroad transcripts. Depending upon your question, it may be helpful to email\ncsuip@calstate.edu\nabout any transcript questions before it is sent to SF State's Registrar's Office.\nPlease note that study abroad coursework does not automatically appear in your degree progress report (DPR) nor does it need to do so. It is recommended that you look at your unofficial transcript in Gateway to view study abroad courses.\nIf your department wants it on there, please wait until your study abroad coursework appears on your unofficial transcript in Gateway. Once it is there, reach out to your college's Student Success advisor. To find your advisor, consult the\nAcademic Advising Directory here\n.\nGeneral Education\nMajor & Minor\nApplying for Graduation While Abroad\nDid you take GE classes abroad? Check to see that your study abroad coursework appears on your unofficial transcript in Gateway. Once it is there, then work with your GE/Student Success Advisor in your college to complete the GE petition to ensure that they fill your GE degree requirements.\nTo find your GE advisor, consult the\nAcademic Advising Directory here\n.\nDid you take major or minor classes abroad?\nIf you previously had them signed off on the Overseas Course Approval Form, then no action is needed.\nIf you took any classes there were not signed off, then you will want to contact the department chair for your major or minor to have them approved now. This is best done before your transcript is sent to SF State.\nThere are two possible ways to file for graduation:\nApply from abroad. This does require obtaining signatures from a distance and review the Undergraduate Admissions’ website for the deadline and pay the $100 fee from abroad. It is recommended that you contact everyone who needs to sign off and have a friend walk the document around. You can try emailing, but for our students in the past things often get lost in someone’s email box. The advantage is that your degree would say the current, but do not anticipate receiving it until the following semester after you return. (For example, if you are abroad in the spring and apply in the spring, then you will get it in fall.) You will get an initial denial letter. This is okay and normal. Wait until you see your study abroad work on your transcript in Gateway and then write to the advisor at the end of your denial letter and let them know it is now here. This takes time and follow-up on your part. The advisor will then re-activate your graduation application (no additional cost) and backdate your graduation to the term you applied. You must be patient with this option.\nWait and apply when you return (for example abroad in the spring and then file in the summer after you return without taking any additional classes). This is our preference since it is easier.  You do not take any classes when you return just meet with everyone and get your application signed off. Since it takes a while for grades to come back from abroad it is easier since this will allow for time for everything to be processed at SF State. Your diploma would say the term you apply. If you apply in summer or fall, then you can walk in the following spring ceremony if you desired You still would not receive your diploma until the next semester after you return.\nWith either option, it is recommended to include a note on top that you are studying abroad this term and that there will be a delay in your work transferring back. Also, with both, you can tell people that you have completed your degree but waiting for the diploma.\nWalking is separate from filing for graduation\n. For example, you can request to walk in spring and apply to graduate in the summer. Please note that walking is only possible in the spring, as there are no university-wide ceremonies in the summer or fall. Therefore, students who have not applied to walk and graduate in the summer or fall can apply to walk in the following spring.\nIf you are abroad and want to walk that term, please first check the dates. When does the term end? If it is not over, can you fly back for the ceremony here and then return abroad? Just be sure to check the final exam schedule as you need to pass your classes.\nGraduation Information:\nApply first online through Gateway.\nSome departments have hardcopy application while others do not. Check your department on the process.\nPay the Bursar. (The first deadline is $100, but if you apply by the final deadline it is only $105.)\nReview the process on the\nGraduation and Commencement website\n.\nNote deadlines on the\nRegistrar's Office website\n.\nReadjusting to Life in the US:\nIEEC\nStudy Abroad Class\nShare Your Experience\nTeach English Abroad\nDo you miss life abroad?

    "content": "SF State Exchange Program Budgets\nSame Tuition + Cheaper Cost of Living + Financial Aid = Study Abroad\nStudents continue to pay tuition only to SF State. The cost difference is the cost of living, which is often cheaper than remaining at SF State. Costs of living in various countries and cities can vary drastically. Though primary costs of living (housing and meals) on SF State Abroad programs\nwill likely be less\nthan what students currently pay in San Francisco, it is important to factor in additional costs when you are making your budget for things such as flight, additional travel, visa and establishment costs.  Please do research on the average range for the student cost of living in the location of your intended program.\nFinancial Aid:\nAll financial aid, except work-study, can be used towards paying for your year abroad. If you receive financial aid, you will be eligible for cost of living adjustments to increase your financial aid award and advances on your aid for your travel and establishment costs.\nFAFSA remember: It is important to always file for FAFSA each year by the deadline, even if you did not receive aid the previous year as your circumstances may have changed. Fill out your FAFSA application based upon being at SF State even for the term(s) you will be abroad.\nConsider Cost-Effective Programs in Chile, China, Czech Republic, Ghana, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nCreate an Estimate Budget Here:\nESTIMATED PROGRAM COSTS\nYEAR\nSEMESTER\nSUMMER*\nTuition\n(SF State Tuition & Campus Fees) **\nCurrent Tuition\nInsurance (Mandatory)***\n$520\n$335\n$275\nHousing\n(Varies by student)\nVaries\nMeals\n(Varies by student)\nVaries\nRound-Trip Airfare and Transportation\n(Varies by student)\nVaries\nVisa Fees\n(Varies by country and citizenship)\nVaries\nOther Expenses\n(Varies by student)\nVaries\nTravel and Entertainment\n(Varies by student)\nVaries\nTotal\nVaries\n*Not all programs are possible for the summer. Confirm duration on the\nSF State Abroad Program Database\n.\n**Students participating in campus study abroad programs are still responsible for paying regular SFSU tuition and campus fees. Tuition and campus fees are set by the Chancellor's Office and are subject to change. Therefore, we recommend looking at the current tuition rate using the link above. International students and nonresident students will continue to pay the same out of state tuition fee.\nIf you are a nonresident of California, an out-of-state or international student, you pay additional tuition fees of $420 per unit or a fractional unit.\n***It is mandatory that all students have\nCSU Travel Insurance\nwhile abroad regardless of any personal insurance and any in-country requirements. Please note that some countries (Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom) also require in-country insurance as well.\nBudget Resources:\nInsurance:\nThe purchase of comprehensive study abroad health and travel insurance is mandated by the CSU regardless of any other insurance you may have. Details can be found on\nRisk Management's website\n.\nPlease note that some countries (Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom) also require in-country insurance as well.\nTuition & Campus Fees:\nStudents pay the same tuition and campus fees while abroad as they would on campus. For current tuition and fees, look at the\nSF State Bulletin\n.\nGraduate students should look\nhere for information on the higher tuition costs\n.\nIf you are a nonresident of California, an out-of-state or international student, you pay additional tuition fees of $420 per unit or fractional unit.\nHousing\nOn most programs, students have choices about where they live with different costs. Students should look at the housing option on their program page on the\nSF State Abroad Program Database\nand insert their preference into their budget above.\nMeals:\nHow much you spend on food varies from student to student based upon personal choices of eating out versus cooking at home. Therefore, it is recommended to estimate how much you spend now on food and then look at the following cost comparison to estimate your food budget abroad.\nClick here to compare the cost of living abroad with San Francisco.\nAirfare and Transportation:\nThis includes your airfare there as well as local transportation costs. For airfare, google flights now to understand the range of what you might pay. A few good sites to check out: google flights, Skyscanner, Student Universe. To understand how much you might pay for local transportation,\nclick here to compare the cost of living abroad with San Francisco\nas well as talk to study abroad alumni and international students.\nVisa Fees:\nVisa costs can change from year to year. They also depend upon your citizenship. You cannot apply for the student visa yet, but you can google the cost of the student visa for your intended country.\nOther Expenses:\nThis includes personal items, such as shampoo, deodorant, etc.\nClick here to compare the cost of living abroad with San Francisco.\nBudget Workshop:\nFor more help with creating a budget, view the online\nBudget Workshop\n.",

After you click on your program, select the \"program cost\" tab to see IP's estimated cost for your program.\nStudying abroad may require so personal adjustments, such as a change in your diet that can impact your health. CDC offers guidelines for Health & Safety for\npreparing to study abroad\n. Also,\nStudentsAbroad.com\nhas topics to consider for health in preparing to study abroad.\nIf you currently take any medication, you should work with your doctor to discuss whether you will have access to or can even carry abroad your medication, as not all medications in the U.S. are legal abroad. Your doctor can assist in this research. Planning early will enable your doctor to have time for this research and, if necessary, change your medication to something that is legal abroad.\nIt is recommended that you obtain a letter from your doctor for any medication you plan to take with you. The letter should state the name of the medication and why you take it. This letter may be helpful when going through customs, as you may be questions about the medications you carry. Additionally, it will make it easier for a doctor abroad to approve refills, as you will not be able to take a semester or years worth of medicine in your luggage.\nWait to make an appointment with your doctor until after you have been selected, as SF State Exchange programs will give you a form to complete with your doctor. CSU IP does not require a doctor's appointment and does not have a form so the appointment can be made at any time.\nIt is recommended that you make a doctor's appointment\nafter\nyou have been selected to talk about vaccinations and immunizations for your study abroad location.\nSF State Abroad does not require any, but only that you follow what your doctor recommends. If your doctor recommends a vaccination or immunization for your country, then you need it. SF State Exchange participants will need to complete a form after selection with a doctor's signature stating that they followed the recommendations of the doctor, including any vaccinations.\nWhen considering where you might study abroad you should research the country.\nThe U.S. Department of State is an excellent place to start. The\nDepartment’s International Travel Information\nallows you to learn more about the country. Additionally, the\nU.S. Department of State’s Current Travel Warnings\nprovide insights into the safety level abroad. We recommend that all students enroll in the Department of State's\nSmart Traveler Enrollment Program\n(STEP).\nHealth and Safety External Resources:\nUS Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs\nCenters for Disease Control\n: Travel Information\nBefriender\n: International Anti-Suicide Help\nDiversity Abroad - Study Abroad Safety for Females\nSAFETI\n: International safety resources\nWorld Health Organization\n: International Travel\nCountry Handbooks\nThe\nU.S. Department of State’s Current Travel Warnings\nprovide insights into the safety level abroad.\nSF State Abroad adheres to the U.S. Department of State’s Travel Warnings and may suspend, postpone, or cancel programs in countries or regions that have travel warnings issued.\nAdditional information is gathered from partner universities abroad as well as students overseas.\nSF State's President has the final say about whether a program is cancelled or allowed to move forward.\nAs a precaution, students are encouraged to discuss with their family and friends their travel plans while abroad and any safety concerns.\nStudents are advised to arrange a way to communicate with family and friends while abroad either through email, Skype, Zoom, or phone.\nPlease note that students, rather than SF State Abroad, will be able to provide family members with the best information on their health and safety while abroad.
