In April, there was a\nGraduate Research and Creative Works showcase\n.\n“The purpose of the showcases is to celebrate and make visible the remarkable research and creative work that our students do. This work often goes above and beyond the traditional classroom experience and highlights the experiential learning opportunities that students have at SF State,” said Kinesiology Professor Kate Hamel, who is also assistant dean of faculty development and scholarship. “These events provide students an opportunity to develop presentation skills and network with peers, faculty and community members.”\nAt the second annual CHSS showcase, Hamel was pleasantly surprised to see that students generally stayed off their phones — which everyone knows is quite a feat — and fully engaged with the event. Students chatted and networked even as the event approached a close.\n“My research experience at SF State has been so encouraging.\nThe Marcus Fellowship\nhas allowed me to delve into topics I’m passionate about from an academic standpoint,” said LCA showcase participant Eleanor Boone, a Political Science major with a Pre-Law certificate graduating this semester. Her work examines the relationship between contemporary religious liberty decisions and sociopolitical minority rights at the Supreme Court level, and conveys the broader implication of the current court’s decisions. “It’s grown my confidence in my abilities as a student, and I hope to continue my research as I pursue higher education.”\nAt the project showcases, students shared their research and creative work to faculty, staff and external community members.\nWhile the Lam Family College of Business doesn’t have a project showcase, it held its annual\nInnovation Pitch Competition\nin April. Students pitched business projects to entrepreneurs, investors and faculty for an opportunity to compete for $10,000 in shared cash prizes and receive entrepreneurship feedback.\nIn addition to the college-level showcases, the University held its annual Student Research Competition, in which SF State students from all colleges shared their independent research. This year, 11 student delegates from the SF State competition advanced to the\n38th CSU Student Research Competition\nat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Four of the SF State participants placed second in their respective categories after competing against hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students from across the 23-school CSU system.\nVisit SF State Create to learn more about these showcases and student research opportunities\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "Carnegie Hall hosts world premiere of associate professor’s composition\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson, SF State News\nJune 2, 2022\nPhoto Credit:\nPhoto by Hailey June Photography\nBenjamin Sabey composes solo work for the haegeum, a two-string fiddle\nA composition by San Francisco State University Associate Professor Benjamin Sabey was among the world premieres on one of the world’s most esteemed stages. Carnegie Hall in New York City was the venue where his solo work for the haegeum, a traditional Korean two-string fiddle, debuted on April 18.\nEunah Noh, a haegeum virtuoso from South Korea, performed Sabey’s 19-minute composition “Scattered Wings” for the first time at the\nCarnegie Hall performance\n, held in the Weill Recital Hall. It is also featured on Noh’s new album, “The World of the Haegeum.”\nSabey discovered Asian music in his early 20s, inspired by its reverence for nature. The traditional Korean style of sanjo and its use of the haegeum caught his ear. Sanjo translates to “scattered melodies” in English.\n“I love the elasticity and mutability of the silk strings of the haegeum and I am fascinated by the bow which can be tightened and loosened at will,” Sabey wrote in his program notes for “Scattered Wings.” “The instrument itself evokes the tension and release of a bird flexing and spreading its wings as it arcs elegantly in the air. The sanjo genre — which melds traditional melodies into a fluid and mobile stream, full of wide vibrato and intricate ornamentation — also strongly evokes, for me, the swoop and weave of a bird in flight.”\nAlthough Sabey does not perform the haegeum himself and it is not taught in American schools, his deftness with Western musical notation played a role in composing for the instrument. He spent hours browsing YouTube for traditional Korean performances and transcribed them by ear.\n“You learn its range, the basic mechanics of how it works, what’s possible and not possible,” said Sabey, who leads the composition, theory and electronic music programs in San Francisco State’s School of Music. “There’s not a lot of new repertoire for that instrument, so there is a lot of a collaboration with the performer. Eunah took my piece and brought her own voice to it as well.”\nSabey hopes that “Scattered Wings” encourages musicians of diverse backgrounds to collaborate and learn about each other’s cultures. He views it as “a prayer for unity in a divided world.”\n“I’ll never be able to fully appreciate the music the way a native-born Korean could appreciate it,” Sabey said. “It’s like learning a second language. You can become fluent in a second language, but if you weren’t raised in that culture, there are things about that language that you’ll never be able to fully understand.”\nAt SF State, Sabey has introduced his students to the haegeum through performer\nJeonghyeon Joo\n. She gave lectures and demonstrations and even performed new student compositions. She will return in the fall for more student-focused work as well as a performance of “Scattered Wings.”\nLearn more about the School of Music at SF State\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Photo by Juan Montes.\nJohnson visited campus to share insights from his “strategic and surprising” career with Journalism and Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts students\nEmmy-winning journalist Whit Johnson (B.A., ’04) has experienced a lot in the 20 years since he was a Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts (BECA) major at San Francisco State University. He was among the first reporters to interview Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi was killed. He reported on the recent total solar eclipse and covered two Olympics. And he just got back from Florida, where he covered Hurricane Helene.\nWhen you’ve had experiences like that, you build up a lot of stories — and Johnson returned to the San Francisco State campus Tuesday, Oct. 1, to share some. The co-anchor of the “Good Morning America” weekend editions and anchor of the Saturday edition of ABC’s “World News Tonight,” Johnson talked to students about journalism, his journey and his advice for launching a successful career. The event, held in SFSU’s Knuth Hall, was moderated by Journalism Professor Venise Wagner, who brought along students from her class “Social Impact of Journalism.”\n“I never imagined that I would end up here [as a network anchor],” Johnson said. “But the one thing that I think I did have going for me was just a work ethic that I developed while I was here at San Francisco State.”\nJohnson grew up in San Francisco, and both his parents are SF State alums. (Johnson’s dad actually joined him for his Oct. 1 visit, and they were both chuffed to talk about how the school evolved from the ’60s to the early 2000s to now.) Johnson came to the University for the broadcasting department — and soccer. He wanted to be a professional player, but injuries halted that journey.\n“While I was here, I sort of evolved from a wannabe morning disc jockey and prank caller to a sports broadcaster to a news broadcaster,” Johnson said. Since the news initially seemed intimidating, he leaned into sports broadcasting. He even voiced Gator basketball, welcoming spectators and doing PA announcements.\nRead the full article on SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Olivia Clarke and Mayuu Kashimura’s brief prevailed over more than 200 others submitted by students from schools like Yale, Clemson and UC Berkeley.\n“I was in shock when I first found out we won,” said Kashimura, a Political Science major who expects to graduate next May. “I remember calling Olivia as soon as I found out, and we were screaming.”\n“I was ecstatic when I found out the news,” said Clarke, who’ll earn her Political Science degree this spring. “It was very surreal finding out that the brief we spent hours working on together had secured first place in the entire competition.”\nMoot courts prepare students for the rigors of arguing a legal case. The brief competitions focus on the written arguments submitted by opposing sides. Clarke and Kashimura’s brief took the side of the respondent — the individual in the case rather than the government — to argue for a hypothetical woman’s right to use birth control as part of her freedom of religion and freedom of privacy.\n“We picked this side because we felt like we were best equipped to argue a pro-respondent side,” said Clarke.\nClarke and Kashimura are members of San Francisco State’s relatively young Moot Court team. The team was created in 2017 when Nicholas Conway came to SF State as an assistant professor specializing in public law.\nRead the full story on SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "SF State alum executive produces documentary on hoops legend Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nFebruary 13, 2023\nPhoto Credit:\nCourtesy of Showtime\nSarah Allen (B.A., ’99) focuses her journalism work on social justice in sports\nTwo decades before Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the National Anthem to protest police violence, another professional athlete faced severe consequences for refusing to salute the flag. Now, a San Francisco State University alumna has brought former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf’s unique story — and the tantalizing style he played the game — to an international audience.\nLongtime journalist Sarah Allen (B.A., ’99) is an executive producer for\n“STAND,”\nthe biographical documentary about Abdul-Rauf featuring extensive interviews with him and other basketball luminaries. It premiered on Showtime on Feb. 3.\n“I fell into it because I really was intrigued by that whole conversation around athletes and activism,” Allen said. “I’m not as interested in giving somebody’s stats on the field. That’s boring to me. Athletes have stories that go beyond that.”\nBorn as Chris Jackson in 1969 in Mississippi, Abdul-Rauf exhibited a dazzling display of skills and athleticism at only 6 feet and 1 inch tall. He used his battle with Tourette syndrome as motivation. “It looked like I was watching God play basketball,” Shaquille O’Neal, a teammate of Abdul-Rauf at Louisiana State University, said in the documentary. Allen said: “Clearly, he was Steph Curry before Steph Curry.”\nAbdul-Rauf’s career was cut short, however, after he decided to sit on the bench during pregame performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” due to the continued oppression of Black people in America. He was suspended and then exiled from the league, and later his home was burned down in an act of white supremacy. Now age 54, he has enjoyed a career resurgence, dominating players much younger than him in the half-court BIG3 basketball league with the same skills he has always had.\n“Mahmoud is just very layered,” Allen said. “When you see his story, he’s had a lot of trauma in his life. When you look at him, he doesn’t seem like he’s been through everything he’s been through. And that is what intrigued me. And again, he’s a conduit for all these messages that are in the film and that I feel we should continue talking about.”\nAllen met Abdul-Rauf at the 2017 National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference, where he won an award. At the time, he was long out of the national spotlight and his story had been largely forgotten. Allen approached him and convinced him to do an interview, his first one-on-one with anyone in years. Their rapport has since evolved into Allen writing numerous stories on Abdul-Rauf and then negotiating his licensing agreement with Showtime and the contract for his 2022 memoir through Kaepernick Publishing.\nAllen’s SF State story\nAllen grew up in the Fillmore District in San Francisco. After high school at Sacred Heart Cathedral, she attended Clark Atlanta University for one year before returning to the Bay Area.\n“San Francisco State has one of the best broadcasting programs in the country, so it was a no-brainer for me,” she said.\nBy Allen’s third semester, though, she found herself on academic probation. She credits fellow Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts student Tiffany Griffith (B.A., ’99) with helping turn her academic career around.\n“She and I became fast friends and we started taking classes together. I started getting motivated to go to class, be awake during class, make sure I do my homework,” Allen said. “I think it took me about a year and a half to get off academic probation. And in a year and a half, I ended up back on the Dean’s List.\n“Once I really took it seriously, the mentors that I had there, they really made sure I succeeded,” Allen added. “And I’m just so grateful I had that experience because it really prepared me for real life.”\nLearn more about the SF State Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department.\nTags\nAlumni\nBroadcast and Electronic Arts\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

A film about Ortiz is available at the\nJohn Gorman Archives\n.\nThe Fran Ortiz Photojournalism Grant was created in 2018 by Reuters photojournalist and editor Gary Cameron in partnership with the SF State photojournalism sequence. Cameron was one of Fran Ortiz’s students and the University’s first photojournalism graduate.\n“I’m particularly proud that the two winning entries of Fran’s Grant for this year are so timely and needed in the current state of affairs in the United States,” Cameron said. “As we moved forward with Fran’s Grant, we too are learning each year regarding the projects submitted, but equally important, the needs of the student to fulfill that project.

    "content": "Design Students’ Magazine Raises Money for Native American Coronavirus Fund, Bail Project\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nJune 4, 2020\nPhoto Credit:\nna\nSaddened and frustrated by the tragedies and inequities of COVID-19, a group of Visual Communication Design students printed a magazine of their artistic responses to the federal government’s response.\nBleach, published in May before the nationwide protests against police brutality began, features contributions from 12 undergraduate and graduate students. In the foreword, Assistant Professor Ellen Christensen described the project as a vehicle for anti-racism.\n“The embrace of white poison by racists and nationalists is fundamentally ironic, given the long history of racist and colonialist associations of whiteness with purity,” she wrote. “Both incomprehensibly violent, and fundamentally bizarre, this current political moment necessitates subversive tactics.”\nThe magazine’s first print run sold out; new copies are at the printer. It may be purchased through Bleach’s Venmo account. All proceeds go to charity. A $10 donation goes to the Partnership with Native Americans’ Coronavirus Emergency Response Fund. All donations above $10 will be given to The Bail Project.\nGraduate student Mena Kamel developed the magazine in Jane Rabanal’s Design Management class after feeling frustration and discomfort when the crisis hit. As he learned of friends and family testing positive, he scrapped plans for another class project to instead self-publish something that would offer agency to him and his peers.\nCiting a lack of attention being given to disproportionately high COVID-19 infection and mortality rates among Native Americans, Kamel said he believed a magazine would expand awareness of inequity issues.\n“I’d already been feeling untethered during the transition to online learning and, like everyone, my world got turned upside down pretty quickly,” said Kamel, who will graduate in 2021. “I was spending all my time on theoretical solutions to this massive moment, and that felt so disconnected from what was/is happening in my personal life.”\nKamel said he is grateful for the compassion of his peers, despite the challenges of the pandemic.\n“Many of my peers/contributors have lost their jobs, family members and housing, yet have stayed in school, organized with me and donated their work for this direct action,” he said.\nTags\nStudent Spotlight\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Hough Jr., professor emeritus of Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts, died on January 1 in San Francisco. He was 93.\nBorn in Trenton, Hough was raised at a family-managed cemetery in the New Jersey countryside. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1950 from Rutgers University, followed by a master’s degree from Northwestern University in 1952 and a Ph.D. at the University of Denver in 1955.\nHough served in the U.S. Air Force Reserves from 1949 to 1955, where he attained the rank of second lieutenant.\nHough taught at SF State from 1962 to 1994. For years, his signature SF State course was interpersonal communication. He led an experimental “New School” program at San Francisco State, team-teaching broad themes such as conflict resolution and images of work, time and leisure. In 1973, he was recognized in Outstanding Teachers of America.\nHe created and performed television series in public speaking, communication theory and the California Gold Rush for two network affiliates, culminating with three documentaries on disappearing gold mining processes for the California Division of Parks. His great joy was creating “Oh My Word,” a game show that aired four years on an ABC affiliate.\nHough was predeceased by his parents, Arthur S. Hough Sr. and Naomi (Young) Hough, and his wife, Humanities Professor Emerita Eleanor E. Morrissey.\nTo send flowers to the family in Hough’s memory please visit the website of\nSullivan’s and Duggan’s Serra Funeral Services.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Thank you for your courage,” he said. “Thank you for your stories. Thank you for your inspiration.

His new book, “The Black Pack: Comedy, Race and Resistance,” offers groundbreaking scholarly analysis on five influential artists of the era: Eddie Murphy, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Arsenio Hall, Robert Townsend and Paul Mooney.\nThese five men joined forces as a comedic collective known as “The Black Pack” and became household names as actors, writers, producers, directors and collaborators. In\n“The Black Pack” (Rutgers University Press)\n, Great cites 24 productions between 1987 and 1994 that defined a generation, both splitting sides and testing boundaries. In a review of “The Black Pack,” the Library Journal praises the book as “an entertaining and essential read.”\n“I call it ‘laugh-tivism.’ The book is a tribute to generations of Black American comedians and how they used their voices to challenge corrupt authority, to confront the racial condition in America and to say very serious things,” Great said. “The book speaks to this notion of revolutionary laughter, but it also speaks to the need for a creative space for laughter as catharsis and the need to create space for Black joy — and to do so through brotherhood and solidarity.”\nRead the full article on SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

The star of the show is Alexandra Lederer, with a four-part installation concerning memories of her late father. In one piece, the full back end of a Camaro convertible juts out of a gallery wall with a boom and sail hanging above it, positioned as if the front of the car has driven through to the “other side.” A U2 album plays on a continuous loop from the car’s speakers. In a gesture she calls “filling his bucket,” Lederer’s installation gives shape to the epic around-the-world journey she and her father intended to take upon his retirement.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Her anthology of political essays\nCall Them by Their True Names\nis on the longlist for the 2018 National Book Award. Solnit has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, the National Book Critics Circle Award in criticism and the Lannan Literary Award for her books.

Her writing has been collected in more than 90 anthologies worldwide and has been translated in German, Japanese and Italian. Lambda Literary Report listed her as one of the 50 most influential lesbian and gay writers of the decade.

The first of two children born to a waitress mother and lab technician father (who also worked as a bartender), the 46-year-old playwright has been fascinated with horror and storytelling since childhood. One of the first movies he ever saw was\nThe Amityville Horror\n, released in 1979.\n“I don’t know why or how a 6- or 7-year-old ended up in that theater but it scared the hell out of me,” he said.\nThen again, the movie inspired a lifelong obsession with the supernatural, something Gomolvilas studied at San Francisco State University, where he earned undergraduate and Master of Fine Arts degrees. “My past plays have dealt with alien abduction, spontaneous combustion, UFOs and now ghosts,” Gomolvilas said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Boots dropped out of school when the group landed a record deal soon after forming. The Coup went on to release six albums, two EPs and tour the world with signature lyrics that relate life’s daily ups-and-downs to the systemic forces at work. All the while, Boots lived the manifestos from his songs, actively organizing and advocating for working class issues like wealth distribution and stronger unions in his Oakland homebase and beyond.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Wednesday, July 05, 2017\nWASHINGTON POST -- Arriving in 1954 to study abstract expressionist art at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute), McClure quickly transferred to San Francisco State to learn from Robert Duncan, a major influence on the area’s poetry renaissance. After the Six Gallery reading, he ascended into a rarefied stratum.\n“What the Six Gallery really did was show us that there was an audience out there that really wanted to hear poetry off the page,” McClure continues, surrounded by overstuffed bookshelves and clay kiln-fired statues of spirit guides made by his wife, sculptor Amy Evans McClure. The decor reflects McClure’s own obsessions with Asian, Native American and abstract art. “That night at the Six Gallery greatly inspired us to go ahead.”\nFluidly gliding through worlds, McClure bridged the gap between Beats, hippies and Hell’s Angels. He invented his own “beast language” and growled those poems to the lions at the San Francisco Zoo. It’s right there to watch on YouTube. His early psychedelic experiments and subsequent “Peyote Poem” blew the mind of Francis Crick, who would soon co-discover the structure of our DNA. Among other songs, McClure co-wrote “Mercedes Benz,” which was soon turned into a hit by his close friend Janis Joplin.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, November 18, 2014\nJust weeks after Attitudinal Healing Connection won an award from SF State, Design and Industry Assistant Professor Steve Jones was honored at the Oakland nonprofit’s 25th-anniversary gala.\nJones was honored with AHC’s Super Hero Award, along with trailblazing journalist Belva Davis, Oakland Post Publisher Paul Cobb and author and Wakan Community founder Tom Pinkson. Awardees were honored November 15 for their outstanding dedication to change and community service work.\n“As a dedicated educator at San Francisco State University and at (California College of the Arts), you have filled the gaps teaching community arts classes, emphasizing ideals of service learning, civic engagement and issues of diversity,” AHC Executive Director Kokomon Clottey wrote in a letter to Jones. “As a creative warrior for change you have emphasized media literacy, analysis skills, nuanced, non-stereotypical, representation of cultural vernaculars.”\nIn turn, AHC has won this year’s Community Partner Recognition Award from SF State’s Institute for Civic and Community Engagement. The Community Service Learning program, a unit within the institute, recognizes and honors one community partner each year for contributing to service learning on campus and in the region. The award was announced in October.\nAHC has worked with Jones and his students for years, through its ArtEsteem program and assisting the agency with marketing expertise. ArtEsteem is an art and literacy program that has helped develop creative, engaged and successful youth by building knowledge and emotional, social, academic and intellectual skills. The program has reached more than 50,000 youth and adults and provided programs to about 57 schools in the East Bay. Jones and AHC staff have served as mutual inspirations and unwavering supporters since first connecting through his Community Arts Design Studio course.\n“Students that work with the Attitudinal Healing Connection have an opportunity to understand what it takes to create sustainable programs in communities. They have an understanding of what it means to work hands on with young people, with families and with individuals to become empowered,” says Amana Harris, AHC associate director. “ …. This is about making a difference — not only in your own life, but also in the lives of many people that live and work and go to school in community.”\nVideo\nLinks\nOakland Post article, October 25, 2014\nAttitudinal Healing Connection\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts interview with Steve Jones, August 25, 2010\nInstitute for Civic and Community Engagement\nSteve Jones\nNews Article",

With a variety of genres — memoir, young adult fiction, short stories, poetry — widespread acclaim follows these titles, reflecting the continued eminence of the Master of Fine Arts program in the literary world.\nMolly Giles\nMolly Giles’\nAll The Wrong Places\n(Lost Horse Press/Willow Springs Editions) won the 2013 Spokane Prize, as “a wild and adventurous read.” The collection’s 19 strange, tightly woven tales merge the mythic and the modern with dark humor and deep humanity. Many of the stories contain contemporary versions of ancient guides: a ghost dog seen by a young drifter in love with a much older guru, a wild goat on a cliff forever standing beside her dead ram glimpsed by a woman whose husband battles cancer, and a volcano goddess with a small dog appearing to a woman whose boyfriend is flirting with her teenage daughter.\nGiles (B.A., ’75; M.A., ’81) is the author of three award winning story collections,\nRough Translations\n,\nCreek Walk\nand\nBothered\n, and a novel,\nIron Shoes\n. Previous awards include the Flannery O’Connor Award for Short Fiction, the Small Press Short Fiction Award, Boston Globe Award, Bay Area Book Reviewers Award, two Pushcart Prizes and a National Endowment for the Arts grant. A professor emerita, she taught at SF State from 1981 to 2001.\nKelly Loy Gilbert\nKelly Loy Gilbert’s debut novel\nConviction\n(Disney-Hyperion) has developed a buzz on the teenage circuit, appearing on numerous summer reading lists and best-sellers charts. “A poignant look at the messiness of love, faith and humanity,” the School Library Journal writes. It explores questions of faith and family through the nuanced story of Braden, a star pitcher whose world is turned upside down when his father is accused of murder.\nLoy Gilbert (M.F.A., ’10) is a fiction writer who believes deeply in the power of stories to illuminate a shared humanity and give voice to complex, broken people. Her writing has appeared in the San Jose Mercury News, Shrapnel and the Kenyon Review. She has served on the NaNoWriMo Associate Board and led creative writing workshops for teens.\nPeter Coyote\nPeter Coyote has remained in the spotlight for his many talents throughout the past five decades. A writer, hippie, activist and actor, Coyote recounts his travels in his second memoir,\nThe Rainman’s Cure: An Irregular Education\n(Counterpoint Press). Kirkus Reviews describes the book as an “artfully rendered chronicle of his intriguing journey from confused, privileged youth to enlightened Zen practitioner.”\nCoyote (attended, ’65) has enjoyed roles in\nE.T.\n,\nErin Brockovich\nand\nCross Creek\n, and narrated more than 120 documentaries for the likes of PBS. He was a prominent figure in San Francisco counterculture, as a founder of the Diggers, which supplied free food, free housing and free medical aid to the hordes of runaways during the 1967 Summer of Love.\nToni Graham\nToni Graham’s\nThe Suicide Club\n(University of Georgia Press) won the 2014 Flannery O’Connor Award for Short Fiction. The people in her eight interlaced stories are “bound together by the worst sort of grief, the kind that can devour you after someone close takes his or her own life.” Wednesday evenings in Hope Springs, Oklahoma, offer the usual middle American options: television, recreation-league sports, eating out and church. For Slater, Holly and SueAnn, it’s when their suicide survivors group meets. Graham (M.F.A., ’96) teaches creative writing at Oklahoma State University, where she serves as editor in chief and fiction editor of the Cimarron Review. Her other short-story collections are also winners —\nWaiting for Elvis\ngrabbed the John Gardner Book Award, and\nThe Daiquiri Girls\ntook home the Grace Paley Prize in Short Fiction.\nQuintan Ana Wikswo\nQuintan Ana Wikswo’s\nThe Hope of Floating Has Carried Us This Far\n(Coffee House Press) is a collection of short stories and photographs. She first derived the book by creation stories told by her parents — a preacher and a physicist.\n“Their stories were perplexingly parallel yet divergent — atoms versus Adam, states of matter, heaven and hell, charged particles, good and evil,” Wikswo says in her artist statement. “I came to realize that the experience of passing in and out of existence is an uneasy one, with no answers, only theories. Unconvinced by their explanations, I concluded I was likely not a human child, and unbound by their rules, I began to create my own.”\nWikswo (M.F.A., ’03) is a writer and visual artist whose work integrates fiction, poetry, memoir and essay with her original photographs, performance and video. Her works are published, performed and exhibited internationally. Her projects have received multiple solo museum shows in New York City and Germany, including the Berlin Jewish Museum. A former human-rights worker, Wikswo uses salvaged government typewriters and cameras to navigate known, unknown and occluded worlds, especially obscured sites where crimes against humanity have taken place.\nJesse Nissim\nJesse Nissim’s full-length book of poetry,\nDay cracks between the bones of the foot\n(Furniture Press Books, 2015), is already a finalist for literary awards, including the top prize from the National Poetry Series Open Competition, first prize from the Cleveland State University Poetry Center’s First Book Poetry Competition, the Kinereth Ginseler Award from Alice James Books, Poets Out Loud Prize from Fordham University Press and Brittingham Prize in Poetry from University of Wisconsin Press.\nNissim (M.F.A., ’05), Humanities Faculty Fellow at Syracuse University, is the author of several poetry chapbooks, including\nNesting Instinct\n,\nSELF NAMED BODY\nand\nAlphabet for M\n. Her book manuscript has been a finalist for the National Poetry Series, Alice James Books Kinereth Gensler Award, Cleveland State University Poetry Center Award and others. She has received grants from the Ragdale and Saltonstall foundations, and her poem “Fire” was selected by Juliana Spahr as the winner of Spoon River Poetry Review’s 2013 Editor’s Prize.\nLinks\nMolly Giles\nKelly Loy Gilbert\nPeter Coyote\nToni Graham\nQuintan Ana Wikswo\nJesse Nissim\nCreative Writing Department\nPhoto: Quintan Ana Wikswo.

Novelist-essayist-poet Boyle, who died in 1992, was one of the expat artists and writers who lived in Paris in the ’20s. In the decades after, she was most famous as a literary figure midcentury. Later, teaching at SF State, she became especially known for political protest, for defying then-President S.I. Hayakawa when students and faculty went on strike. Last week I came upon a letter she sent to the Chronicle in ’89, commenting on a story that said “the solution to the homeless problem in Marin County has been postponed until after Christmas.” That was “sensible,” she wrote, but why not postpone it until after the new year? “The week after Christmas is inevitably a time when innumerable demands are made — such as disposing of the mountain of discarded wrapping and boxes under the Christmas tree.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Monday, December 10, 2018\nTHE INDEPENDENT (LONDON) -- Riley fits snugly within the definition of artist-activist. It’s a draw he’s felt since childhood. He was born in 1971 in Chicago, to parents who had met during a student-led strike at San Francisco State University. His father volunteered as a housing and welfare rights advocate and a car industry organizer before working as a civil rights and criminal-defense lawyer.\nHis parents moved to Oakland, California, when Riley was six and by the time he was 15 he had joined the radical Progressive Labor Party. In 1991, he co-founded The Coup, acting as primary lyricist. Their work was deliberately confrontational, with album titles such as\nKill My Landlord\n(1993) and\nPick a Bigger Weapon\n(2006), although he recently dismissed the former as “a pamphlet on tape,” adding he’s now more interested in speaking to audiences who don’t directly identify with his politics.\nWhich is exactly what\nSorry to Bother You\nsets out to achieve, aided by a cast of recognizable faces as Tessa Thompson and Armie Hammer also star. The film takes the familiar tropes of dystopian fiction — corporate giants as sinister authoritarian forces, for example — and places them distinctly in today’s timeline. Riley’s point is that dystopia is now, and always has been.\nPhoto: Boots Riley (left) and actor Lakeith Stanfield on the set of Sorry to Bother You.

The proposal is part of a transformation the university campus has experienced in recent years, including a $2 million renovation of the campus gymnasium in 2014 and the construction of an $86.5 million wellness and recreation center that is slated for completion in 2017. Construction of the new Creative Arts Building and concert hall at Tapia Triangle is expected to begin in Fall 2017 and last two years.

    "content": "‘Boundaries are crossed, but new ones form’: Professor reflects on LGBTQ movement\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson, SF State News\nJune 6, 2022\nPhoto Credit:\nPhoto by Hannah Anderson\nUC Press publishes ‘Queer Public History: Essays on Scholarly Activism’ by Marc Stein, the Jamie and Phyllis Pasker Professor of History\nOver the last 40 years, San Francisco State University Professor Marc Stein has played multiple roles in the fight for LGBTQ rights and liberation. He has protested in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, reported for Gay Community News and written books and essays revealing little-known historical events.\nHis new book,\n“Queer Public History: Essays on Scholarly Activism”\n(University of California Press), is a collection of more than 30 pieces he has written primarily for newspapers, magazines and blogs over the years.\nStein\nis San Francisco State’s Jamie and Phyllis Pasker Professor of History. He joined the University in 2014.\nWhat motivated your new book?\nPerhaps because I was a journalist in the 1980s (first as the editorial page editor for my college newspaper and then as the coordinating editor of a national gay and lesbian newspaper), I’ve long been interested in writing for larger public audiences that would not be reached by lengthy scholarly essays or books. I thought it would be interesting to reflect on change and continuity in how queer historical writing influences and is influenced by public audiences (queer and not) and how academic and community-based scholars have worked together to make queer history.\nThe book also includes essays on scholarly activism, meaning scholarship written and used for activist purposes. Some academics think that scholarship is tainted by association with activism, but activism was necessary to make a place for queer history in higher education.\nWhen reviewing and reflecting on your past writings, what emotions and memories struck you?\nWell, the book includes personal essays that address the political depression and despair that I’ve experienced as a gay man, as a social justice activist and as a young queer studies academic struggling to find a place within higher education. At the same time, working on the book made me reflect on the importance of tenacity and resiliency, the value of political emotions (including anger, disappointment and frustration), and the life-sustaining power of friendship, mentorship, community, solidarity and humor.\nWhat does the book reveal about the state of LGBTQ people in America today compared to when you first became involved in activism and scholarship? What progress has been made and where are areas of growing concern?\nI think even the most cynical and pessimistic among us can recognize that in many areas, LGBTQ people have experienced remarkable progress over the last several decades. At the same time, the best queer historians — and the best historians — are skeptical about linear progress narratives.\nChange can lead to backlash. New freedoms come with new regulations. Boundaries are crossed, but new ones form. Some gain; some lose. If we take the example of how queer history is taught in primary and secondary schools, we now have states that mandate inclusion, and we have other states that are mandating exclusion. That doesn’t align with a straightforward (pardon the pun) narrative of progress or a straightforward narrative of declension.\nOn June 14, you will give a talk at the San Francisco Public Library about the emergence of LGBTQ activism at SF State. What developments will you discuss?\nThe talk, titled\n“Queer Transformations at San Francisco State, 1969 – 1972,”\nis timed to coincide with the amazing\nQueer History Conference\n, which will bring hundreds of scholars, teachers, students and others from around the country and world to our campus. (Our incoming provost, Amy Sueyoshi, is one of the conference organizers.)\nMy presentation draws on a multiyear collaborative research project that I’ve undertaken with two SF State classes, which explored sexual politics at SF State in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I’ll be exploring the early emergence of LGBTQ activism at our University, including queer support for\nthe Third World Liberation Front strike\n, the formation of SF State’s Gay Liberation Front, the power of gay faculty labor activism, the police shooting of an SF State student at a downtown gay bar, protests of an airline that refused to board a student wearing a “Homosexuals for Peace” button, the hiring of an openly lesbian professor, conflicts between lesbians and trans people at a campus gay dance, and the development of the college’s first LGBTQ studies courses.\nPrior to the late 1960s, what was campus life for LGBTQ students at SF State?\nJudging by what we know about other colleges, there were probably many challenges — anti-LGBTQ messages in courses, cultural invisibility, social rejection, threats of suspension and expulsion. I think institutions such as SF State could do much more to acknowledge, take responsibility for and redress these ugly moments in their histories. But there likely were also love affairs, sexual encounters, intimate friendships, social networks and lessons about resistance, struggle and empowerment.\nThe only specific stories we’ve encountered about that period come from Richard Wallace Love (a.k.a. Richard Amory), a married veteran and father who wrote one of the best-selling gay novels of the 1960s (“Song of the Loon”) while doing his M.A. in Spanish at SF State in the early 1960s. In the early 1970s, Love came out as gay, joined the gay liberation movement and denounced the exploitative publishing contracts that he, along with many other gay writers of that era, had to sign in order to have their work published.\nIt’s also interesting that he claimed that what made it possible for him to write the novel, in secret, was that SF State provided him with a private office on campus. It’s a great story about how an SF State education, if accompanied by the right kinds of material support, can lead to impressive outcomes.\nHow has the SF State community had an impact on broader struggles for LGBTQ liberation?\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, LGBTQ struggles on and off campus were influenced and inspired by the Third World Liberation Front strike and other struggles against racism, sexism and colonialism. SF State faculty and students were local, regional and national leaders in gay liberation (Charles Thorpe), lesbian feminism (Sally Gearhart), gay literature (Richard Love) and gay/labor alliances (Morgan Pinney). Beyond the Bay Area, Berkeley and Stanford might be better known, but SF State was the city’s main public university, and San Francisco emerged as a center for LGBTQ liberation in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nLater, and I don’t know much about this history, SF State made groundbreaking faculty hires in LGBTQ studies, established LGBTQ-affirmative programs in Sexuality Studies and Women and Gender Studies, and facilitated LGBTQ studies research in the Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality and the National Sexuality Resource Center, which eventually combined to become the Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality.\nToday in 2022, LGBTQ studies faculty at SF State are somewhat fragmented and scattered in multiple administrative units, including Cinema, Ethnic Studies, History, Sociology and Sexuality Studies, and Women and Gender Studies, and there’s more the institution could do to coordinate, promote and support our work, but I believe we have one of the largest and most impressive collections of LGBTQ studies faculty anywhere in the world.\nLearn more about the History Department at SF State\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "Tuesday, June 06, 2017\nSF STATE NEWS -- The free speech, the civil rights and the anti-war movements were all present on campus starting in the early 1960s, according to SF State Political Science Professor Robert Smith. The Summer of Love was just one of these movements — the drug use and free love were another way of expressing dissatisfaction with the predominant culture, he said. “There was a lot of cross-fertilization. People were going back and forth from one movement to another,” he said. “There was a confluence of different protest movements and they eventually moved into one mass protest against the Vietnam War.” SF State’s various protests very quickly became a model for other colleges and universities in California and eventually the rest of the country, Smith said. That was particularly true of the five-month student strike for ethnic studies and greater representation of minorities on campus in 1968 to 1969. “I remember coming up here when I was a student at Cal State Los Angeles to see how to organize,” he said. “It had kind of a ripple effect. San Francisco State students went to Brandeis to help them organize there for Black Studies.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, November 27, 2018\nThe Nasiri family story may sound familiar. A young man, Steve Saeed Nasiri, moves from his native Iran to Berkeley for college, supports himself by working at restaurants and eventually becomes a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and angel investor. But this American success story hasn’t been told yet. It will be soon, in a new film produced by San Francisco State’s Documentary Film Institute and Center for Iranian Diaspora Studies.\nWe Are Here, We Have Always Been Here\nis the first documentary to focus on the Bay Area’s Iranian community. The Nasiri Foundation recently contributed a $10,000 grant to the film.\n“Now more than ever, the Iranian American community is understanding the necessity of being more organized as a diaspora — to share our stories loudly, to be proud of where we came from and to vocalize all that we have contributed to our adopted country,” says Shanna Nasiri, fund manager for the Nasiri Foundation. “We need empathy, not just for the Iranian American community, but for immigrants at large.”\nWe Are Here\ndocuments the complex personal histories that have brought Iranians to the Bay Area for more than 70 years, spanning four generations.\nThe greater San Francisco area is home to the second largest Iranian population in California, and likely the second largest outside of Iran itself, says Persis Karim,\nWe Are Here\nco-director.\n“This is an evolving community that continues to shape the Bay Area through arts, culture and innovation,” says Karim, director of the Center for Iranian Diaspora Studies and a professor of Comparative and World Literature. “They continue to grapple with the historic trauma of leaving Iran under difficult circumstances.”\nUltimately, the film conveys the resilience and determination of this community, despite the political turmoil that has shadowed Iranian Americans for decades.\n“It isn’t easy to pick up and leave your place of birth, oftentimes on your own and away from your family,” Shanna Nasiri adds. “It takes a lot of drive and motivation, and I think the Iranian American community in the Bay Area is a phenomenal example of how those qualities can be channeled to make a significant and positive impact in the world.”\nSoumyaa K. Behrens, Documentary Film Institute director and Cinema lecturer, is the other co-director of\nWe Are Here\n. She says the film employs a personal aesthetic that focuses on how historic events in the Bay Area and Iran have affected the community.\n“The mosaic of personal and historical elements shows a picture of Iranians deeply rooted in the Bay Area,” she says.\nThe film will be completed in March 2020. Josh Peterson is consulting editor. Students will help with production, post-production and archival research.\n— Matt Itelson\nLinks\nNasiri Foundation\nDocumentary Film Institute\nCenter for Iranian Diaspora Studies\nPhoto: Soumyaa K.

To foster more participation, Lee and his students authored the Sunshine and Open Government Act of 2015, Proposition E, which San Franciscans will be asked whether to approve Tuesday. Proposition E would require public meetings, testimony and comments to be accessible through electronic and prerecorded means, according to its ballot language.

The latter recalls Mifune’s commanding presence  in “Seven Samurai,” by saying it “felt like he had been created by the forces of seismic activity.” Ironically, a young Mifune, who was adept at karate, archery and swordsmanship, had no intention of becoming an actor. He wanted to work behind the scenes as a camera assistant, but there was no keeping him out of the spotlight. He would go on to make 170 films.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Thursday, June 04, 2020\nSPUTNIK INTERNATIONAL (MOSCOW) -- The partisan divide is going to play out a lot in the coming elections, opines Anthony Pahnke, assistant professor of International Relations at San Francisco State University.\n“People talk about the partisan divide. I think we’re seeing that now more than ever,” he says. “There’s a different dynamic in each state. The big question is, right now — how is this partisan divide going to show up in the election? Meaning who can get out, who can turn out the people further in their parties. It’s the question about turnout.”\nThe professor admits that the Americans are significantly polarized about the candidates: those who don't like Trump will vote for virtually any Democratic candidate; similarly, those who don't like Biden and Democrats will side with Trump despite all odds.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Facebook and Twitter are not only feeding our desires, but shaping them.\n“We sort of become programmed by the technology that was supposedly programmed for us,” Tuman said.\nThe more we eat the snackable content served up on social media, Tuman said, the more we crave it.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Jewish Food Fights: Students Get Appetite for Culinary Traditions",
    "content": "Thursday, May 09, 2019\nPhoto by Roger Habon\nThe Department of Jewish Studies has sanctioned food fights all semester long. No actual food has been reported to have been flung, however, in Rachel Gross’ Jewish Food Fights course, which explores the politics of religion, food and eating among Jews in America since the 19th century.\nIn this Q&A, Gross — the John and Marcia Goldman Professor of American Jewish Studies — dishes on how students can learn about cultural traditions through cuisine.\nWhat gave you the idea for the course?\nYou are what you eat, as the saying goes. Studying what people eat and how they talk about food is a great way to learn about their lives and how they think about themselves and others. I’m a religious studies professor who studies American Jews, and American Jews have thought carefully about how what they eat makes them different from and similar to other Americans since the colonial period.\nProfessors at other universities have offered classes on studying religion through food, but I was one of the first to offer a course that traced American Jewish history through food studies. We go from how colonial Jewish merchants connected Jews in the Americas and Europe through transporting and selling food all the way to Urban Adamah, the Jewish farm in Berkeley, and Covenant Winery, the kosher winery in Berkeley. We’re taking a field trip to both of those places in May!\nHow often do you teach it?\nThis is my third year at SF State, and so far I’ve offered it once a year, in the spring.\nHow have students responded to the course?\nLike all of our Jewish Studies courses, it’s attracted a wide range of students from all backgrounds. The course is designed to help students analyze the world around them, whether or not they’re Jewish. For me, the most exciting moments in the class are the material we study, helping students think about their own lives, their families and their communities. The role that food plays in their lives and the way it defines them and their communities.\nI also love studying primary sources with students — when we can laugh about the ridiculous things people included in early 20th-century cookbooks but also think carefully about what it tells us about the people who made those cookbooks and how they might have used them.\nI also really like thinking about really ordinary things with students, and asking what they tell us about the people who make and use (or eat) them. Today we talked about what the history of bagels tells us about American Jews. It’s such an ordinary item that we might overlook it in our day-to-day lives, but thinking about the way it moved from a specifically Jewish food item in the early 20th century to one eaten every day by many Americans today helps us think about the place of Jews in the United States and the way they’ve influenced American culture more broadly.\nCan you let us know some of the visiting scholars and more about food journalist Alix Wall’s work and how it benefited your students?\nAlix Wall spoke as part of the department’s #JewishStudiesAnd series and in conjunction with my course. The series is designed to introduce students to a wide variety of professions in which they can use the skills they learn as a Jewish Studies or other humanities major.\nIn the American Jewish food course, Alix’s writing about Jewish food, especially but not only her writing in the J. newspaper is a primary source through which we can learn about Jews and food in the Bay Area. But having her speak helped students learn how she does her research and reporting. Students are required to write a paper as a newspaper article on a local site of Jewish food, and I explicitly point to Alix’s writing as a model for them.\nHaving her speak about her Jewish food writing also demonstrated that our course subject matters to people in our community, beyond the classroom. We aren’t studying this topic in isolation.\nAny thoughts about how the Jewish Studies program can benefit a prospective student applying to SF State?\nThe Department of Jewish Studies is devoted to the study of the history, culture, religion, politics and literature of the Jewish people. We’re a small, warm department of faculty members who deeply care about our students, so they don’t get lost in the shuffle of a big school. Our majors, minors and other students in our courses are from all and no religious backgrounds.\nTo me, studying Jews is just a way of studying people in general, and our faculty members introduce students to history, politics, film studies, pop culture studies, comparative literature and religious studies. For me, the most interesting thing to do in life is to learn about what’s meaningful to people and why those things matter to them. My courses help students questions about what’s been meaningful to American Jews as a way of asking questions about how people make meaning — including how my students do so in their own lives.\n— Ufuoma Umusu\nLinks\nFood Fights: The Politics of American Jewish Consumption from 1654 to the Present\nNostalgia is Key Ingredient in Your Pastrami on Rye, says SFSU professor, J., April 27, 2017\nRachel Gross\nNews Article",

For 10 years, he advocated for the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, founding a nonprofit to conduct research and craft messaging to persuade lawmakers, the public, and even the generals that allowing gay troops to serve openly would not harm military readiness. For Pack the Courts, Belkin hired Sean McElwee, a 26-year-old social media whiz who helped popularized the idea of abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to do polling and research. Belkin recognized that the best way to introduce bold reform is in a crowded Democratic primary, with candidates eager to attract media attention and win over the party’s liberal base.\n“The emergencies we are facing are so extreme that if you are going to run for president, it’s not enough to have policy ideas,” he says. “You have to explain how you are going to pass those ideas and then how you are going to protect those ideas from the courts.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Professors’ book addresses role of prejudice in plight of ride-hail drivers\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nApril 12, 2022\nPhoto Credit:\nProfessors’ book addresses role of prejudice in plight of ride-hail drivers\nRace and gender are major factors why taxi and ride-hail drivers are ‘Spent Behind the Wheel,’ write Women and Gender Studies Professors Julietta Hua and Kasturi Ray\nRide-hail drivers face many of the same problems that have existed since the invention of the automobile, according to a new book by two Women and Gender Studies professors from San Francisco State University. While drivers’ struggles to make a living wage have generated much fanfare and legislation in the last decade, age-old stereotypes also dominate the occupation of those who drive passengers from one place to another.\nJulietta Hua and Kasturi Ray wrote\n“Spent Behind the Wheel: Drivers’ Labor in the Uber Economy”\n(University of Minnesota Press) after observing a correlation between the boom of the tech industry and the growing wealth inequality in the Bay Area following the 2007 – 2008 financial crisis. SF State’s Office of Research and Sponsored Programs and George and Judy Marcus Funds provided grants to support the book.\n“We have seen, to our dismay, the growth of\ngig workers\nbeing drawn from populations that are historically marginalized,” Ray said. “The work conditions under the new gig economy were not that new after all. It is something that racialized men have experienced in the U.S. throughout history.”\nDeeply rooted stereotypes persist about the danger of the immigrant male driver transporting other people, they found.\n“A city council person actually characterized taxi drivers as potentially raping your wives and daughters,” Hua said. “In the labor world, I don’t think people have necessarily thought about how the gendering of drivers is an important component of keeping drivers in low-wage situations.”\nDrivers and judges both pointed out to Hua and Ray that non-white gig workers receive an exorbitant amount of parking tickets and traffic violations.\nThe difficulty of using the bathroom has been linked to high rates of cancer and other diseases among taxi drivers, a Columbia University study found. Businesses are more likely to deny men of color the use of public restrooms, Hua and Ray said.\n“They’re racialized back into the servant class, where you’re not supposed to have a body; you’re just supposed to drive and meet your fill,” Ray said. “In that way, gender, race, nationality, class and privilege are seen so clearly in the health risks that taxi drivers are taking for us every day.”\nHua and Ray researched the book through firsthand interviews with drivers, labor organizers and members of licensing commissions. They also pored over case law, scholarly publications, social media posts, public meetings from municipal taxi commissions and media coverage. They spent a great deal of time with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance and spoke to former Uber, Lyft and cab drivers in the Bay Area.\nTheir analysis is based on a feminist perspective, and their scholarly interest in labor. Combining their respective expertise in sex work and domestic work, they define taxi and ride-hail drivers as “reproductive laborers.” In other words, the job involves attending to another person’s needs and wants, similar to a housekeeper or nanny. Unlike most other “reproductive labor” jobs that have been “feminized,” professional passenger drivers have traditionally been men of color, predominately immigrants.\nThese nuanced issues are something to be mindful of when getting a ride.\n“Understand you are in someone’s workplace and very well might be their home,” Ray said. “Make your expectations in accordance with workers’ lives. Support drivers’ fights for dignity because it affects you.”\nHua added: “This is really about not taking for granted and fairly compensating people’s labor. Support minimum wage laws — like the Fight for $15 to raise the national minimum wage — and other efforts that try to raise the working conditions of all people.”\nLearn more about the\nWomen and Gender Studies Department at SF State\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "Tuesday, June 25, 2019\nBAY AREA REPORTER -- As the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion approaches, long considered the birth of the modern gay rights movement, people may think that they know what transpired and why it was so important. However, Marc Stein, professor of History at San Francisco State University, is convinced there is not one paradigm, but many conflicting experiences with multiple interpretations that color our understanding of this LGBTQ origin story. Attempting to reclaim the Stonewall story for queer people on their own terms, Stein, a gay man, has collected 200 documents (many not easy to access) drawing from both primary and secondary sources that include mainstream, alternative and LGBTQ media, covering the period 1965 to 1973, in his new book, “The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary History” (NYU Press). “There were multiple inspirations. I continue to be inspired by LGBT activism in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the decades before I came out and became an activist myself in the 1980s,” Stein says. “I wanted to encourage others to be similarly inspired, without losing sight of the importance of constructive criticism. I also knew that the 50th anniversary celebrations would create teachable moments — opportunities to revisit the Stonewall era and reconsider the developments that preceded and followed the riots.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, October 21, 2014\nCourtesy of Geffen Playhouse\nVeteran movie star Annette Bening gave an inspiring talk on acting and the arts in a familiar place — the Little Theatre — on October 10.\n“So many things are running through my mind right now. I’m kind of emotional to tell you the truth, because I spent a lot of time in this theatre,” she said. “.... I wanted to first say that the reason I feel kind of emotional coming here is because I was you.”\nBening is an alumna of the Theatre Arts Department, class of 1980, and remembers her time fondly. During the talk, the four-time Academy Award nominee recounted a lecture she herself had attended as a student, when the late American Conservatory Theatre founder Bill Ball spoke. Ball was later to become her mentor at ACT, where she launched her acting career.\nLaura Wayth, an actress and assistant professor of Theatre Arts, interviewed Bening. The session included a Q&A with students as well. During the conversation Bening addressed various topics with aplomb, including tips on auditioning and thoughts on her personal process, often standing up and walking around the stage to demonstrate techniques.\nShe implored students to keep a positive attitude and always have a strong belief in their acting.\n“Doubt is something you just never get rid of, so don’t even try. Just stop right now,” Bening said. “Insecurity, you’ll always have it. So in a way, I’m saying that to reassure you and to encourage you, not to discourage you.”\nShe also suggested how students can talk to parents who might not approve of a future career in the arts. “You tell them, ‘I understand you have my best interest at heart, but I’m going toward this path,’” she said.\nBening, who has four children with her husband, actor/director Warren Beatty, also discussed the ways in which her career has changed since starting a family, stating that she often decides on projects based on whether or not film fits into her family’s schedule. The filming location of her most recent film\nThe Kids are All Right\n, was changed from New York to Los Angeles to accommodate her availability as well as the original vision of director Lisa Cholodenko (B.A., Interdisciplinary Studies, ’87).\nThough best known for her roles in movies such as\nAmerican Beauty\nand\nBugsy\n, Bening still adores her first love: theatre. Earlier this year she performed and directed\nRuth Draper’s Monologues\nat Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, garnering critical acclaim.\n“The intellectual size that you have to possibly reach for, combined with incredible emotional content — That’s what gets me about the theatre,” she said.\n—Lynn Brown\nNews Article",

Some embrace America immediately and, like the Poseidonians, erase their culture. Others try to marry the two traditions. A telling example of saving the phenomena of both cultures comes from the poetry of Thanasis Maskaleris. His book, “My Life on the Ragged Paths of Pan,” is testimony of a life in perpetual struggle. Maskaleris came to America in the 1950s from Arkadia, Peloponnesos, home of the gods, especially Pan, beautiful villages, countless olive trees and mountains. He studied literature and taught comparative literature at San Francisco State University, where he was also instrumental in the creation of the Center for Modern Greek Studies. But Maskaleris is fundamentally a poet speaking in the often-illuminating language of poetry. His book includes original poems and translations from some of the most insightful of modern Greek poets.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The study was funded by the progressive group Take Back the Court, which has openly championed court-packing as a solution to a conservative judiciary.\nIn the study, participants were asked to choose between two hypotheticals: a “status quo” scenario and a scenario in which a Democratic Party candidate proposes court-packing to “bring greater balance to the court” while the Republican Party candidate laments how it would be “a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rights of all Americans by radical liberals trying to change the rules so a few cities in New York and California can impose their will on the rest of us.” According to the study, scenario two had almost no impact on people’s choices.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, November 19, 2019\nGraduate student Jason Appler discovered his passion for product design in an unlikely place: an administrative office in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He has experienced the thrills of traveling through dangerous waters as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and as a NOAA Corps officer. But design theory is what motivates him now.\nIterative problem-solving processes based in design theory have become all the rage at leading companies and universities worldwide. Appler first utilized them when working as a strategic planning lead in NOAA’s Office of Performance, Risk and Social Science. The office doesn’t make products, but uses design theory to help the agency’s leadership plan effective policy. Appler says it helps disparate groups of people think creatively as a group and step outside of their box.\n“It’s the same process when you develop an app or widget,” says Appler, who holds a bachelor’s degree in biology from Villanova University and an MBA from the Naval Postgraduate School. “You feel the pain of the person who has the problem. You keep reiterating until you find a strong solution.”\nYou feel the pain of the person who has the problem. You keep reiterating until you find a strong solution.” — Jason Appler\nAppler recently won the Jerry Streichler Scholar Award from the western U.S. region of Epsilon Pi Tau, an international honor society for design and technology. He received the award at the society’s 90th anniversary board and trustee members conference in September in Orlando, Florida.\n“Jason demonstrates great capacity for leadership. He has a certain humbleness about himself,” said Design Professor Ricardo Gomes, who serves as trustee for SF State’s Beta Beta chapter of Epsilon Pi Tau. “He exemplifies a mantra that I use often: Design with us, not for us. He represents that collective, inclusionary approach to design, getting the best attributes of his team and adopting them in a collaborative, cohesive manner. ”\nAt SF State, Appler has used his leadership skills and design-theory experience to tackle numerous problems. Last year he founded the Design Guild, a student-run organization for professional development. He also led a team of students creating an online platform that connects youth volunteers with senior citizens. The project was a finalist in the Stanford Center on Longevity Design Challenge. For his thesis, Appler has designed an efficient kitchen system for adults living in shared home environments.\n“The beauty of the Design M.A. program at San Francisco State is that it provides a strong foundation in the theory and process,” he said. “By going here, I have a stronger foundation to give me flexibility in my future pursuits.”\n— Matt Itelson\nLinks\nEpsilon Pi Tau\nJason Appler\nSchool of Design\nNews Article",

Nonetheless, in our newest analysis, we examine the feelings expressed by Trump supporters towards a variety of groups in America, and the results are pretty clear: Trump supporters really dislike many identity groups in America. For these voters, Trump’s blend of casual racism and muscular nativism is the core of his appeal.\n“Trump supporters are more likely than supporters of other Republican candidates to have negative feelings toward feminists, Muslims, Latinos, gays and lesbians and transgender people. These findings also hold when compared to supporters of Hillary Clinton. In contrast, Trump supporters have far warmer feelings toward whites than supporters of other candidates.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Faculty-Student History Team to Create Graphic Novel Exploring First Black Marines\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nDecember 1, 2021\nPhoto Credit:\nIllustration by Liz Clarke\nSan Francisco State University Professor Trevor Getz will again bring an overlooked piece of history to light through a nonfiction comic book. Created with History undergraduate Robert Willis, the “The Montford Point Marine Project” will tell the stories of the first Black U.S. Marines, who served in World War II. The story is based on new oral histories of their experiences. It will be published by Oxford University Press in 2024.\nAimed at a high school and undergraduate audience, “The Montford Point Marine Project” will foreground the meaning and lessons the veterans themselves draw from their service and experiences. In a unique design, the book will include digital resources linking readers to interviews with Montford Point Marine veterans. These interviews are possible thanks to a contribution from The Boeing Co., and will be filmed in December by a team led by Cinema Professor Daniel Bernardi and San Francisco State alumnus Jesse Sutterley. Members of the National Montford Point Marine Association will also help direct the writing and design of the graphic novel.\nIn 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt outlawed racial discrimination in war industries, allowing Black men and women to serve in a segregated fashion. The Marines recruited Black men and sent them to Jacksonville, N.C., at Camp Montford Point, where about 20,000 African Americans trained between 1942 and 1949. The Montford Point Marines, as they came to be known, remain active in public service, support for their veterans and preservation of their legacy.\n“The Montford Point Marine Project” is the follow-up to Getz’s award-winning “Abina and the Important Men: A Graphic History” (Oxford University Press, 2011). That book depicts the life and trial of Abina Mansah, a woman living in 19th-century colonial West Africa who escapes slavery and takes her former master to court. Like “Abina,” the new book is designed to be a guide to historical research, in this case focusing on community-based oral history methods.\nThe team bringing this story to life includes Getzand Willis along with Montford Point Marine historian Gunnery Sgt. Joe Geeter III and artist Liz Clarke. “Through the life stories of the Montford Point Marines, we hope to train and inspire teachers and students to collect, interpret and value the memories, experiences and wisdoms of earlier generations,” Getz said. “The Montford Point Marine Project” has also received funding through the\nMarcus Undergraduate Research Assistantship Grant\n.\nTags\nDepartment of History\nVeteran Documentary Corps\nMarcus\nUndergraduate Research\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

If you ask Bill Issel, San Francisco State University History professor emeritus, it always has been. Issel said “the three Ps” — pioneer spirit, patronage and Pacific orientation — were instrumental in forming the city’s artistic and cultural identity. “It was the place to be if you were young and adventurous,” said Issel, pointing to San Francisco’s instant population explosion during the Gold Rush and the fact that newcomers stayed because they weren’t tied down by institutional constraints. Larry Eilenberg, a professor of Theatre Arts for SF State, said the city was home to more than 1,100 productions — plays, operas (in five languages) and minstrel shows — from 1850 to 1859. “It was an extraordinary hub; all this money was rushing in,” Eilenberg said. On the literary front, SF State’s Poetry Center was founded in 1954 from a donation by W.H. Auden and City Lights Bookstore, Eilenberg said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

In 1973, a gay bar in New Orleans was set on fire in a case of suspected arson, and 31 people were killed. No one was ever charged, and there was very little national media coverage about it at the time.\n\"There’s a lot of attacks on gays bars, sometimes by individual or groups, often street violence against people who are coming and going to gay bars,\" said Marc Stein, professor of History at San Francisco State University.\nLGBT businesses, health centers, community centers and other public sites have also been targeted for attacks over the years. Stein himself worked at a LGBT newspaper that had been targeted with violence.\nAs Stein noted, there were demonstrations, riots and protests pressing for LGBT rights, especially throughout the 1960s. Influenced by other growing radical groups, including those for civil rights for blacks, women’s rights and the anti-war movement, groups advocating civil rights for gay people saw the importance of more public activism. Each year on July 4 from 1965 to 1969, protesters marched in support of LGBT rights in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, an event known as the “Annual Reminder.”\nPhoto by Mario Flores\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "'Tasting Difference': Professor Shahani Examines Recipes, Race in Early Modern Literature",
    "content": "Friday, October 30, 2020\nPhoto courtesy of Gitanjali G. Shahani\nWhen the witches in “Macbeth” call for the “fire burn and cauldron bubble,” they don’t just use a ghastly recipe to cast a spell. They invoke ethnic tropes — a historic literary reference to race — according to Professor Gitanjali G. Shahani’s new book,\n“Tasting Difference: Food, Race and Cultural Encounters in Early Modern Literature”\n(Cornell University Press).\nThe witches’ spell in William Shakespeare’s 17th-century “Macbeth,” still recited at Halloween school parties worldwide,  calls for discriminating ingredients: the liver of a “blaspheming Jew,” nose of a Turk and lips of a Tartar. It’s a recipe that labels people of certain groups as outsiders.\n“In addition to things like burnt snails and the chopped-up ears of a cat, one recipe calls for pounded skulls, preferably those found in the graves of Ireland,” added Shahani, chair of the English Language and Literature Department. “Some of these recipes are disturbing in the way they describe draining corpses of black and brown bodies for mummy, which was believed to have curative and cosmetic properties, and was consequently imported in large quantities via Egypt.”\nInternational exchange of food developed in the early modern period of 1500 – 1800. Taste buds expanded and new cuisines were created, but cultural differences were otherwise often not accepted. Early modern literature is stocked with references to food and medicine made from urine, dog tongues and unicorn horns. “It’s not the kind of stuff you get at Trader Joe’s!” Shahani said.\nIn researching “Tasting Difference,” Shahani studied plays, pageants, domestic manuals, cookbooks, ballads, travelogues and more. She discovered that early modern food writing evokes feelings of danger and allure. In “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” a character mentions a “spicèd Indian air by night.”\n“Long before the average English household encountered ‘an Indian,’ it encountered nutmeg and pepper in pies and potions,” said\nShahani\n, a Shakespeare scholar who studies connections between food and literature. “It is in the writing about these tastes, in the culinary realm that I saw an early conception of racial, cultural and religious difference being articulated.”\nA 17th-century broadside sheet depicts coffee as a dark figure from Shakespeare’s “Othello.” Contemporary food brands continue to perpetuate racial tropes with the title character, a dark-complexion Moor from Africa. Her SF State students introduced her to “Othello” chocolates, cookies and lattes made in the Bay Area.\n“When I was teaching ‘Othello,’ it was my students who kept pointing to the ways in which so many characters describe wanting to consume or devour all that is exotic about him,” Shahani said.\nExamining literary descriptions of food can help people can become more informed about today’s societal issues, including immigration, Shahani says.\n“Is it the immigrant we seek to keep out, while welcoming their culinary offerings?” Shahani asks. It’s something to think about when eating or reading (or both), as the calendar moves from Halloween toward Thanksgiving. “Food frequently becomes the means of rendering difference more palatable.”\n— Matt Itelson\nVideo\nNews Article",

Now his second feature, “Headshots,” has won a string of awards on the film festival circuit in the USA. Mr. O’Neill went on to study film at the University of East Anglia in Norwich and San Francisco State University. After graduating, he came back to Leeds and worked in various jobs including roles at banks and selling double-glazing over the phone — but never gave up on his dream and “kept firing out screenplays” to Hollywood production companies.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

They, along with Willie Brown and later Pelosi, engineered what became known by critics as “the Burton Machine.” Willie Brown met John Burton in 1951 when both were freshmen college students at San Francisco State University. “We were in the same ROTC unit, believe it or not, probably avoiding the draft,” Brown recalled with a chuckle recently. “We were alphabetically lined up the first day.

    "title": "Art Lecturer Sean McFarland: An Echo in the California Landscape",
    "content": "Thursday, October 19, 2017\nDuring his year teaching in Rochester, New York, Sean McFarland rarely took pictures. He spent more time working with his personal archive of images of the Western landscape. After returning to his beloved San Francisco in 2015, McFarland has again thrived in the Bay Area’s art community, teaching at SF State full time and garnering stellar reviews.\nArtforum, the world’s premier art magazine, reviewed and recommends McFarland’s solo exhibition at the Casemore/Kirkeby gallery in San Francisco.\n“Sean McFarland treads lightly through the history of Western landscape photography,” critic Kim Beil writes. “In this exhibition,\nEcho\n, he utilizes the familiar iconography of mountains and waterfalls, but his treatment undermines the presumptions of truth, power and possession that have long been associated with the genre.”\nEcho\nat Casemore/Kirkeby is on display through October 28. Works by McFarland are also featured in the SF State Fine Arts Gallery exhibition\nRecollected: Photography from the Archive\n, open through November 16. As a winner of the 2017 SECA Art Award, McFarland was also featured in a recent exhibition at the SFMOMA.\nA landscape that ‘transcends skepticism’\nMcFarland, a lecturer in the School of Art, constructs his artwork using found photographs, double exposures, prismatic effects and various light-sensitive materials. He has also incorporated found materials such as bottle caps to create moons and glass to create mountains. Using the suggested immediacy of Polaroids and photography’s claim to veracity, McFarland plays with our notion that when we see something we feel like we are there.\nHe hopes that his work makes people reflect upon nature and the environment.\n“Normally Polaroid pictures hold ordinary events like birthday parties or family trips,” McFarland says. “When used to represent the sublime in the landscape, our understanding of the medium as this handheld, rapid, intimate and immediate process does something special — we see a rare or impossible view as both accurate and accessible.\n“When I create collages and sculpture assemblages then take Polaroids of them, we read those images as truthful accounts of, say, a stunning mountain, even if the source material is a hunk of Plexiglas,” he adds. “Why do we do that? We have a capacity to be amazed by the landscape that transcends skepticism.”\nHe cherishes the natural beauty of Mono Lake and the Glass Mountains in the Eastern Sierras as much as the human-made “diorama” of Golden Gate Park. All are some of his favorite places to shoot photographs.\n“The way I work allows me to access a range of materials and depictions of the land as a part of the Earth because they describe ways we contend with understanding the landscape,” McFarland says. “This approach allows me to move between historical and contemporary constructions of the natural world, a very complex archive in the western United States.”\nInspired by SF State’s students\nMcFarland entered Humboldt State University as a computer information sciences major, not discovering photography until his junior year. He completed his bachelor’s degree as a double major, then moved to San Francisco in 2002 to pursue his Master of Fine Arts from California College of the Arts.\nAt SF State, McFarland teaches undergraduate photography courses and interdisciplinary Master of Fine Arts seminars and advises students. He views SF State as the ideal campus for art students and instructors alike.\n“It is so desirable to be able to teach at an arts school that students can afford to attend,” he says. “Students come from all different disciplines. The range of interests and differences of my students is inspiring.”\nHe enjoys sharing with his students the struggles and triumphs of his career.\n“My personal and professional experiences have been very humbling,” McFarland says. “Make mistakes. Be open to your path and your career. As a teacher and an artist, it’s important to remain active and knowledgeable about how art can challenge and be relevant, and to live that exciting process with students.”\n— Matt Itelson\nVideo\nSean McFarland: Impossible Wilderness\nfrom\nYBCA\non\nVimeo\n.\nLinks\nSean McFarland:\nEcho\n, Casemore/Kirkeby\nRecollected: Photography from the Archive\nReview in Artforum\nSFMOMA SECA Art Award, Sean McFarland\nSean McFarland\nSchool of Art\nPhoto: Sean McFarland in his studio at the Minnesota Street Project in San Francisco.

He was like, ‘Now you have all these things to pull from when you’re looking for new stories, and you can go back to these.’ It was around this time that I started realizing that my process involved starting with theme more than character. So when I was looking over the list of things I had generated in his class, I realized that consent and sexual assault and rape were something that I was really interested in, but I didn’t want to approach it in the sense that I see it so often done.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Monday, November 10, 2014\nSAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE -- Dance at SF State, says associate professor and dance coordinator Yutian Wong, utilizes two studios for its three dozen courses. The one in the gymnasium is larger, but the fine-arts space, FA 203, was created especially for dance, with sprung floors to reduce strain and injury to the joints, marley floor covering to prevent slipping, mirrors, adjacent locker rooms with showers, as well as bleacher seating, pipes rigged for lighting and a sound system. “I was really shocked when we were told in July that we would be losing the studio,” she says. “At the time, I was told that the size of program did not warrant all the square footage that we had.” According to Daniel Bernardi, interim dean of the College of Liberal & Creative Arts, the dissolution of the space is simply a consequence, if not unintentional, of a larger series of consolidating moves for all departments.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

And that’s how he met his future co-founder of the Charlatans, Richard Olsen, who’d left Chicago a year or so earlier to study jazz and maybe, just maybe, make it as a musician in the vibrant jazz scene in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood.\n“I actually met Lucy before I met George,” Olsen says. “She was a dancer, and I was a music major, studying clarinet—we were both in the creative arts department at San Francisco State.” Before long, Hunter and Olsen were collaborating with Lewis on the dance performances she was choreographing with her roommate, Joan Alexander. Lewis recruited Olsen to be one of her dancers. Hunter, whose interest in hi-fi audio components was as keen as his affinity for architecture, provided the sounds.\n“George was into in tape music,” Lewis says, referring to a genre of prerecorded audio championed by composer John Cage. “We gave him this little broom closet to work in, and he transformed it into a music studio.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Now he is one of four artists featured in the commission’s\nArt on Market Poster Series\ndevoted to the original peoples of the San Francisco Bay Area.\nPotosí’s six posters, titled “The Future of the Ramaytush Ohlone,” are on display at 15 Muni bus shelters on Market Street between Seventh and Steuart streets through Friday, Feb. 28. Each poster centers a figure against a backdrop that depicts historical and cultural locations in San Francisco, enhanced with native plants and animals. The designs also include silhouettes inspired by historical paintings of the Ramaytush Ohlone, accompanied by text reflecting the Indigenous tribe’s cultural values and aspirations. The Ramaytush Ohlone tribe comprises the Native peoples of the San Francisco Peninsula.\n“Marcelo Potosí’s artwork beautifully and masterfully intertwines the rich cultural history of the Ramaytush Ohlone with visionary ideals for the future,” said Ralph Remington, director of cultural affairs for the San Francisco Arts Commission. “Through his striking poster designs, Potosí honors the deep-rooted legacy of the Ohlone peoples, while urging us to envision and reimagine a future grounded in respect for the land, its original stewards and the environment.”\nPotosí says he finds the Ramaytush Ohlone have much in common with his own Indigenous roots. He is a Kichwa-Otavalo person from Ecuador.\n“They are dedicated to giving back to the land and protecting it from pollution. This is also something we honor back in Ecuador,” said\nPotosí\n(B.A., ’24), who works as a freelance graphic designer. “By creating this poster series, I was trying to show the goals that the Ramaytush Ohlone have, and also just to let people know who the original peoples of this land were.”\nRead the full article at SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

He says uncovering the real story can teach all Americans a lot about privilege, historical memory and the way we construct our own stories.\n“I tell this story in the hopes that, even in the contemporary period, folks can take a deep breath and pause, whatever their initial reaction will be, to, you know, Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, Farrakhan, Nation of Islam, all the topical issues now, and they’ll be better informed to understand the dynamics if they understand and see what actually happened over the last 50 or 60 years,” Dollinger says. “Clearly in Trump’s America, we have a variety of different constructed narratives, and everyone’s got a bunch of facts to prove that they’re right.

Yukihiro Goto, a Theatre Arts professor at SF State, was among the 85 others who came to enjoy the performance. “They don’t even need to know the words, they got the message through the actions and dances of the puppets,” Goto said regarding the potential language barrier of the all-Japanese performance. “Even though the puppets aren’t alive, they seem to come alive through the artistry of the three puppeteers. The beauty of the performance transcends language.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

In “The Lucky Day,” Rose drives overnight to visit her mom in another state to wish her a happy birthday. Dealing with a serious illness and living with her son, Sam, her mother asks that Rose to take her to the races.\nThis immediacy runs through many of the stories; Chai captures the love, frustration, anger, disappointment and more that seeps through these family relationships: There’s the woman who is trying her best to live with her in-laws until she can no longer bear it; there’s the young daughter reeling from the discovery of her mother’s affair; and there's the young boy who appears docile and humble in front of his grandpa but leads a very different life on the city streets. In many ways, these characters seem to lead double lives — but maybe that’s just what being part of a family is all about, according to Chai.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Journalism Alumna Lands New York Times Fellowship",
    "content": "Friday, May 07, 2021\nPhoto by Daniel Kim\nIn fifth grade, Sarahbeth Maney (B.A., ’19) started carrying a camera with her everywhere. To this day it hasn’t left her side. In junior high school, after reading National Geographic, she decided she wanted to be a photojournalist. So when it came time to apply to college, she chose San Francisco State University, which was close to home in Martinez and had a photojournalism program. Now, two years after graduating, she’ll embark on a career-defining journey, camera still in hand.\nIn June, Maney begins a yearlong fellowship with The New York Times, along with 32 other promising young journalists and media professionals. The program replaces The New York Times’ summer internship program. Fellows work in areas ranging from graphics, science and art to photography. Maney will be based in Washington, D.C., and will do the work of any beat photographer covering stories on and off Capitol Hill. She’ll also get to travel with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThe fellowship was a long time in the making, she says. During and after college she held internships at the San Francisco Examiner, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Flint Journal in Michigan. As a freelancer, her work has appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal, among other well-known publications. This was her third time applying for the fellowship at The New York Times, and she says she was in shock when learned she got the position.\n“She is a talented photographer and a compassionate person, and you can see those qualities in her pictures.” — Lecturer Scot Tucker\n“I felt really proud of myself, especially because representation is really important,” she said. “To see the first-ever mixed-race woman in the White House as vice president, that was inspiring for me. When I realized I’m going to be able to document this time in history, it was an unbelievable feeling of excitement.”\nIt’s not just that she’ll be part of something historic, it’s personal for Maney. Like Harris, Maney is also multiracial. “Being a mixed-race woman and not growing up seeing a lot of people who looked like me, I think it’s really important to provide that sense of representation and let people know that their stories are relatable and that they matter,” she added. And those are the stories she hopes to continue telling.\nManey is someone who understands the importance of documenting Black and Brown communities, says SF State\nJournalism\nLecturer Scot Tucker, who taught her Introduction to Photojournalism class. “She is a talented photographer and a compassionate person, and you can see those qualities in her pictures,” he said.\nWhen she heads to Washington, she hopes to tell the human side of policy and how laws affect people’s daily lives, she says. One of the lessons she learned at SF State that she’ll take with her to Washington is the importance of reporting topics that are personal. Faculty encouraged that, she adds. “They wanted us to stay true to ourselves because we all have different perspectives to bring,” she said.\nThat’s one of many kernels of professional wisdom she gleaned from SF State. The others: anticipate the movement before it happens, be a good person and be sensitive. Having empathy is especially important these days, she notes. “With the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement, it takes an extra level of sensitivity,” she said. “I feel like they prepared me to cover these tough situations.”\nBut it may be that she was just born for this. People trust her, says Tucker. “She recognizes the role of a journalist in the community. ... She takes amazing pictures, but the pictures aren’t for her,” he said. “She’s there to tell the story of the community. She recognizes she’s there to tell someone else’s story.”\n— Jamie Oppenheim\nNews Article",

    "content": "Tuesday, September 16, 2014\nSF STATE NEWS -- The Morrison Artists Series, San Francisco’s longest-running chamber music series, will launch its 59th season this month at SF State and run through May 2015, featuring free performances by six innovative music ensembles. This season’s diverse lineup includes a cappella singers from Norway, a quintet of woodwind instruments and a San Francisco-based, Grammy-nominated piano duo. “A lot of people have never experienced chamber music or been to a concert,” said Richard Festinger, professor of Music and artistic director of the series. “In this area, like other metropolitan areas, it’s the symphony and opera that are well known to the general public. For a lot of people, chamber music may slip under their radar. But almost all major composers have written significant works of chamber music.\" In many cases, Festinger added, chamber music is considered the “crown jewel” of a composer’s repertoire.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

They strive to help students understand the impact athletes have on political and social issues.\nJaulus, an SF State graduate with a master’s degree in Political Science and an avid sports fan, feels that sports are held in high regard and give athletes a unique platform to express their opinion. Sports have a rich history of athletes being the focus of social issues, like Muhammad Ali refusing to be drafted and protesting the Vietnam War.\n“I hope we’re at the cutting edge of a revolution,” Jaulus said when talking about the amount of big name athletes such as LeBron James, Kaepernick and others speaking out and protesting issues they care about.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

To ordinary Iranians and reformists, that made him a hero. To hard-liners, though, he was a dupe, seduced by the West into a deal that the Americans would never live up to. Now, with the nuclear deal on the brink of collapse, with the Trump administration reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, and with Tehran threatening to restart elements of its nuclear program, Mr. Zarif is coming under renewed fire not only from hard-liners in Tehran but also from Washington.\nAt the top echelons of the Iranian political system, where knowledge of the United States is generally shallow and suspicions run deep, Mr. Zarif stands out for his ease among Americans. He came to the United States at 17 to attend college, and was an undergraduate at San Francisco State University in 1979 when the Islamic revolution broke out in Tehran. (He pitched in by helping lead a group of student revolutionaries who took over the Iranian consulate in San Francisco.)\nRead the full story\nFeed",

It is, indeed, the gift that keeps giving.\n“I never could have imagined this,” says the El Cerrito native, who assumed the role in 2005 on “The Closer,” which ran for seven seasons before spawning its spin-off. “When you’re an actor — especially an actor of color — anything longer than two weeks is cause for celebration.”\nAs a teen growing up in the East Bay, Chan’s first love was music. He and his pals formed a rock band that did gigs at high school dances and frat parties. But by the time he reached San Francisco State, he was bitten by the acting bug.\nFour decades later, Chan’s résumé features more than 300 episodes of television and 35 feature-film roles.\nPhoto by Eddy Chen/TNT\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Grad Student Who Triumphed Over Trauma Named CSU Trustee Scholar",
    "content": "Thursday, October 08, 2020\nYuri Madenokoji came to San Francisco State University intent on moving forward with her life. For her, that meant confronting trauma. Madenokoji immersed herself in English literature and Women and Gender Studies to heal from sexual violence she had experienced. (She prefers to keep the details private.) Now, as a student in San Francisco State’s Graduate College of Education, she hopes to use what she learned to empower the next generation of scholars.\nThe California State University (CSU) recently recognized Madenokoji for rising above her traumatic experiences while achieving academic excellence and staying focused on social justice. She’s one of 23 CSU students to receive the CSU Trustee Award for Outstanding Achievement, the highest academic honor given annually by the CSU to students from each campus.\nAs a future educator, she wants to help young people unlearn oppressive thinking and behaviors. “After taking Women and Gender Studies courses, I began to understand the systemic nature of violence,” said Madenokoji. “Being an educator, I want to help students gain that analytical lens to navigate this complex world.”\nSan Francisco State Associate Professor of English Summer Star, a former professor of Madenokoji’s, says there couldn’t be a more deserving candidate for the award. Because of the flexibility it offers students, the CSU attracts people at different junctures in their lives and careers. “It’s a place for people who are self-starters and self-motivators,” she said. “Yuri is the poster child of self-motivation. The challenges she’s faced make her achievements and her tenacity all the more exceptional.”\nMadenokoji wants to use education to uplift people, specifically marginalized groups. “She’s interested in teaching in a way that empowers students, no matter their background, and to instill a belief that they are a power for good. And that begins with feeling worthy,” Star added.\nGrowing up, Madenokoji says she didn’t know how to talk about difficult subjects like racism or sexism. She just didn’t have the language for it. But after studying feminist theory, she saw the world in a new way. She saw how marginalized people have been harmed by invisible systems, like white supremacy and sexism. It’s a revelation she’d like to share with her students.\nPeople aren’t born racist or sexist, she says. These ideas are learned and internalized. “It’s our responsibility to undo the system of oppression. Otherwise we are complicit in it,” she said. “The first step in breaking out of the cycle of oppression is to put a name to it.”\nShe plans to use literature as a gateway for exploring some of these topics and for helping students understand what’s happening in the world right now, she says, whether it’s social, political or economic. “And then from there we can talk about what we can do in our own lives to work toward justice,” she said. “I want to be the kind of teacher who doesn’t just teach the current curriculum but also nurtures the heart and soul of students.”\n— Jamie Oppenheim\nNews Article",

Eleven years ago, hoping to get into a doctorate program but needing a job, he landed an interview at Garfield to teach high school English. Before the interview, he studied the school’s test scores and demographics, feeling well-prepared when it began.\n“And I remember the principal at the time said, ‘Well, is that all you know about Garfield?’ I said, ‘Yeah,’ and I was a little surprised because I had just spat out all these facts.

The cutting process is all done by hand with an X-Acto knife. Lipps then traces the magazine cut outs on cardboard and finds a background for them. “It’s a slow process,” added Lipps.

She is also a founder and director of SF Sketchfest, running the annual live comedy festival since 2001.\n“I was in love with San Francisco as a place and an idea and a life, so I left school in Arizona during my junior year of college, and then worked to establish residency for a year, so I could go to SF State with in-state tuition.\nThere I met my (now many-years-running) two partners, Cole Stratton and David Owen. We were in a sketch group together with a fourth member, Gabriel Diani — now he’s an independent filmmaker, I’ve done a couple of his movies and he’s a genius. But Gabe took time off to go do a one-man show, and we decided to organize a festival, so that we had more of an opportunity to do a long set of sketch in San Francisco. There weren’t a lot of venues that allowed for that or were made for that. ...\n“By the time I moved to San Francisco I had sort of pragmatized my way out of thinking I would be a performer for a living. But my friends at SF State, Dave, Cole, and Gabe, cajoled me into being in the sketch group that they were forming. And I’m so glad they did. It was really the first time that I had officially done comedy. I loved doing funny plays and stuff like that, but I wasn’t one of those kids that got involved with an improv group in high school.

As a child, she moved from England to Switzerland to Los Angeles as her father, the scientist Edward De Robertis, built his career. Coming to the U.S. when she was 10, “from other countries that were not my country of origin,” she says, “I had this feeling and experience of having a country inside my skin that wasn’t outside my skin.”\nShe went on to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, and moved to the Bay Area in 1997. “I bounced around between San Francisco and Berkeley, following the lower rents at the time, working at different activist jobs, and as a substitute teacher. And then I had this very formative experience in my mid-20s when I was about to marry a woman, the love of my life, with whom I’ve had these two children, and my parents disowned me. One of the things that they said was that I couldn’t be Uruguayan anymore, because I was gay. Because I didn’t exist in their country.\n“When I was younger, back when I was writing that first novel, I thought I’d never feel at home anywhere in the world. I thought belonging was just something that would never be fully possible for me,” De Robertis says. “But I’ve built a life in the Bay Area with my wife and kids and with chosen family, and a community that we have forged where there is room for all of us. Because there’s enough openness and possibility for families like mine.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Philosophy Professor Jacob Needleman Gives Himself Spiritual Pep Talk in New Book",
    "content": "Thursday, November 10, 2016\n“Among the great questions of the human heart, none is more central than the question, ‘Who am I?’” Jacob Needleman approaches meaningful material with frankness in the introduction of his most recent book,\nI Am Not I\n(North Atlantic Books). A professor of philosophy at SF State for more than 50 years, Needleman tackles life’s existential mysteries through a unique dialogue between his 82-year-old self and his younger counterparts at progressing ages, offering them the illuminating wisdom he has amassed over decades of pursuit.\nHow does rejecting our certainties liberate us? What does inner consciousness truly mean? Needleman acts as guiding counselor to his young self, Jerry, who seeks answers to these questions in the author’s shortest title on profound concepts to date.\nI Am Not I\nis a departure from Needleman’s previous tomes on philosophy due to its feasible-for-teens language and arrangement into play form. A graduate of Harvard University, Yale University and University of Freiburg, he pioneered an in-depth study on diverse, alternative faiths in his landmark text,\nThe New Religions\n, published in 1970. The Harvard Bulletin called it “a vital study of a phenomenon that has dramatically altered the lives of those it has touched.” He has written 20 books on philosophy, life purpose and God, but\nI Am Not I\nis his most personal achievement yet.\n“This book I wanted to be for the younger generation,” Needleman says, “so I started writing it to my students but suddenly I started writing to me. I was once young. And I started writing it as a dialogue between me, a grown man of 82, and Jerry, which was my nickname when I was 14.”\nThroughout\nI Am Not I\n, Jacob eagerly incites Jerry to think less with his intellectual brain and feel more with his metaphysical mind, to reach higher levels of enlightenment. Stage and camera directions scatter the dialogue, providing an atmospheric tone.\nWhile Needleman says some consider philosophy to be “logical, analytic, dry and reductive,” he emphasizes the ever-present need for questioning one’s beliefs and ideologies.\n“You can never exhaust the ideas of philosophy,” he says. “Philosophy at its root is about how to live, not just how to think. The world is always changing; truth has to be worked for. You have to make real truth your own. Our deeper truths are never old; they’re always discovered.”\nNeedleman explains that his courses must attend to the appetite of the soul, “or whatever you want to call it,” he quips. Philosophy, as he proposes, should feed a “sharp, clever, analytical mind as well as a deep metaphysical heart.”\nIndependent thought is a tenet of his teaching ideology. One of his most memorable moments as a teacher happened when a student said, “You really want us to think for ourselves, don’t you? No one else does.” Needleman recalls the earnestness in her voice as one of the most beautiful things he had ever heard.\nBy bringing age-old questions into modern conversation, Needleman aims to be a catalyst for the consciousness he believes all human beings yearn to awaken at some point in their lives. For many, the hunger for greater knowledge begins as young as 14 and peaks during college. This insatiable curiosity in young people initially drew Needleman to teach at SF State in 1962. Needleman finds that the longing for deeper contemplation, and the innate struggle between the logical and metaphysical, has not waned in his students since then.\n“Whatever I have to give, it’s needed. If I don’t try to transmit what [understanding] I have, what I have will be taken from me,” he says. “When I feel there’s a real need for what I’ve learned, especially within the students, I discover that, somehow, from somewhere, I am given a little bit of something like wisdom.”\nBut after 50 years of imparting knowledge, what have his students taught him about learning? Needleman surprises even himself with his answer. “The fundamental character trait for teaching is the ability to listen. ‘What’s behind the question?’ ‘Who are they?’ Listening is the vibration in the exchange between us.”\nNeedleman is technically retired, but still teaches at SF State every other semester as he considers young adults the most vital investment. He plans to teach a class this spring. He is also in early talks to adapt\nI Am Not I\nfor the screen.\nWhen asked what he looks forward to in the rest of his life, he replies, “More and more of what I have done. More and more attempts to communicate to others what I have been fortunate enough to receive. The more of that, the better.”\n—Gospel Cruz\nLinks\nI Am Not I\non Amazon\nJacob Needleman\nPhilosophy Department\nPhoto: Jacob Needleman in his home office. Photo by Gospel Cruz.\nNews Article",

If you get used to kids trying to take little advantages like getting out early, telling you, ‘Oh, we don’t have to do this work,’ then you can have fun with them and laugh it off.” For DeAndreis, working as a sub and coaching baseball at his alma mater, Lowell High School, facilitates his ability to pursue writing as he attends night classes at SF State.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The documentary will explore five ancient Judeo-Christian monuments in Iran to promote cultural harmony in an effort to dispel narratives of fear, exclusion and mistrust. The documentary is centered on inclusive, diverse and equitable narrative and constructivist frameworks in search of common cultural heritage and similarities between Judeo-Christian, Iranian and Islamic architecture, art, aesthetics and culture.\n“I am excited about this project and thankful to both the college committee and the LCA leadership for giving me the opportunity to highlight our common humanities despite all the noise promoting otherness and us against them mentality through my project,” says Khani. “This project is an attempt to contribute to our diverse, yet similar, stories and experiences in line with the LCA's mission ‘to find collective solutions to pressing global and social issues.’”\nJohnny Symons\n“Get Your 10s” is a feature-length documentary planned by Associate Professor of Cinema Johnny Symons that follows Rashaad Newsome, a Black queer artist from the American South, as he creates his most ambitious project yet: a multi-platform, experiential performance at New York City’s Park Avenue Armory. Complete with a 30-foot hologram, a gospel choir, the premier vogue dancers from the US, Japan, Brazil, and Ukraine, and a spirited non-binary artificial intelligence named Being, Rashaad transforms a historic military building into a sanctuary for healing and celebration. In the process, he reveals how art and ballroom culture can help us collectively imagine a brighter future.\n“In the wake of the pandemic and a difficult economy, it’s an especially challenging time to complete a feature-length documentary and this award provides me with the ability to dig deeply into crafting this important story. At a time when LGBTQ+ lives are being increasingly denigrated and legislated, this film showcases the talents of queer, trans and BIPOC artists and dancers and inspires us to use our imaginations to work towards a more equitable world,” says Symons. “The time and funds afforded by this award will go directly towards editing, finishing and releasing the film in festivals and streaming services, with the collaborative support of SFSU students and recent alums.”\nYutian Wong\n“Dancing in the Archives of Sincerity” is a book planned by Theatre & Dance Professor Yutian Wong about the intersection of a global health crisis, the resurgence of anti-Asian racism, and dance studies. Using the Korean pop music act BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondon) as a case study, the book examines how conversations about racism/xenophobia, homophobia, cultural hierarchies, and the roles and responsibilities of the artist in society are taking place from the space of Asian popular culture.\n“How dance is produced, performed, and taught changed overnight when theaters, studios, and other public spaces closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to Professor Wong. “Long-held assumptions about dance and how to conduct dance research were completely upended, so my book is a response to teaching about dance and doing dance research in the aftermath of a global health crisis. This Marcus Transformative Research Award affords me the time to reflect on this massive disciplinary shift and complete the book manuscript.”\nAbout the The Marcus Transformative Research Award\nThe Marcus Transformative Research Award\nprovides one semester leave with pay and a $3,000 research budget. The award is made possible by the George and Judy Marcus Funds for Excellence in the Liberal Arts, which was established in 2018 with a $25-million gift to SF State.\nSF State alum executive produces documentary on hoops legend Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nRead more\nabout SF State alum executive produces documentary on hoops legend Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nSarah Allen (B.A., ’99) focuses her journalism work on social justice in sports\nTwo decades before Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the National Anthem to protest police violence, another professional athlete faced severe consequences for refusing to salute the flag. Now, a San Francisco State University alumna has brought former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf’s unique story — and the tantalizing style he played the game — to an international audience.\nLongtime journalist Sarah Allen (B.A., ’99) is an executive producer for\n“STAND,”\nthe biographical documentary about Abdul-Rauf featuring extensive interviews with him and other basketball luminaries. It premiered on Showtime on Feb. 3.\n“I fell into it because I really was intrigued by that whole conversation around athletes and activism,” Allen said. “I’m not as interested in giving somebody’s stats on the field. That’s boring to me. Athletes have stories that go beyond that.”\nBorn as Chris Jackson in 1969 in Mississippi, Abdul-Rauf exhibited a dazzling display of skills and athleticism at only 6 feet and 1 inch tall. He used his battle with Tourette syndrome as motivation. “It looked like I was watching God play basketball,” Shaquille O’Neal, a teammate of Abdul-Rauf at Louisiana State University, said in the documentary. Allen said: “Clearly, he was Steph Curry before Steph Curry.”\nAbdul-Rauf’s career was cut short, however, after he decided to sit on the bench during pregame performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” due to the continued oppression of Black people in America. He was suspended and then exiled from the league, and later his home was burned down in an act of white supremacy. Now age 54, he has enjoyed a career resurgence, dominating players much younger than him in the half-court BIG3 basketball league with the same skills he has always had.\n“Mahmoud is just very layered,” Allen said. “When you see his story, he’s had a lot of trauma in his life. When you look at him, he doesn’t seem like he’s been through everything he’s been through. And that is what intrigued me. And again, he’s a conduit for all these messages that are in the film and that I feel we should continue talking about.”\nAllen met Abdul-Rauf at the 2017 National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference, where he won an award. At the time, he was long out of the national spotlight and his story had been largely forgotten. Allen approached him and convinced him to do an interview, his first one-on-one with anyone in years. Their rapport has since evolved into Allen writing numerous stories on Abdul-Rauf and then negotiating his licensing agreement with Showtime and the contract for his 2022 memoir through Kaepernick Publishing.\nAllen’s SF State story\nAllen grew up in the Fillmore District in San Francisco. After high school at Sacred Heart Cathedral, she attended Clark Atlanta University for one year before returning to the Bay Area.\n“San Francisco State has one of the best broadcasting programs in the country, so it was a no-brainer for me,” she said.\nBy Allen’s third semester, though, she found herself on academic probation. She credits fellow Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts student Tiffany Griffith (B.A., ’99) with helping turn her academic career around.\n“She and I became fast friends and we started taking classes together. I started getting motivated to go to class, be awake during class, make sure I do my homework,” Allen said. “I think it took me about a year and a half to get off academic probation. And in a year and a half, I ended up back on the Dean’s List.\n“Once I really took it seriously, the mentors that I had there, they really made sure I succeeded,” Allen added. “And I’m just so grateful I had that experience because it really prepared me for real life.”\nLearn more about the SF State Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department.\nAlum directs ‘The Murder Inc. Story’ docuseries on BET, and it’s a hit\nRead more\nabout Alum directs ‘The Murder Inc. Story’ docuseries on BET, and it’s a hit\nSF State helped Michael J. Payton develop his love for hip-hop into a career\nWhen San Francisco State University graduate Michael J. Payton posted a YouTube video about hip-hop record label Murder Inc. four years ago, he didn’t expect it would get him hired as director of the official docuseries for national television. But it did.\n“The Murder Inc. Story”\npremiered on Black Entertainment Television (BET) on Aug. 9 and hit No. 3 trending on Twitter. Payton (B.A., ’15) directed all five of the one-hour episodes and interviewed icons such as Ja Rule, Jay-Z, Nas and Daymond John.\nIn early 2019, label founder Irv “Gotti” Lorenzo posted an all-points bulletin to his 1 million Instagram followers: “Whoever knows Michael Payton. Let him know to reach out to me. ‘Cause I am gonna let him be [a part] of the Big Official Documentary.”\nThat same night, they connected over the phone and Gotti tapped Payton to direct the series.\nMurder Inc. recording artists like Ja Rule, Ashanti and Lloyd dominated the charts in the early 2000s, shattering Guinness World Records. Federal money laundering charges against Gotti and his brother would contribute to a fast downfall, though they were acquitted. The music retains legacy and influence, as it has for Payton since age 12.\n“I remember being enamored with their mystique and the whole brand,” said Payton, who grew up in Oakland. “It’s really a story of hope [and] belief in oneself. That’s one of the things I’m most fascinated by with hip-hop culture. It was all from the minds of very young people who had nothing. If you believe and have a passion and work hard, you can change the world.”\nAn SF State vibe\nAfter high school, Payton selected SF State for its audio production and music recording program in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts (BECA) Department. He discovered a hip-hop community that would not only shape his career, but also provide him with a deep scholarly understanding of the genre that he loves.\nHe took Africana Studies courses with\nDawn-Elissa Fischer\n, an anthropologist renowned for her research of hip-hop and other aspects of Black popular culture.\n“He is a great communicator and peer educator,” Fischer said. “He created pathways and opportunities for many students, and he has continued to do so for those who came to SF State after him.”\nIn the\nAfricana Studies Department’s\nHip-Hop Workshop course, he served as assistant to Fischer and\nDave “Davey D” Cook\n. Davey D and Payton reunited for “The Murder Inc. Story,” where Davey D appears as a historian.\n“[Including him in the docuseries] was one of my proudest moments,” Payton said. “He was a big anchor for a lot of the cultural context in this story, and BET just loved him and his contribution.”\nCommuting from Antioch, Payton would arrive on campus early in the morning and stay as late as possible. He was active in the\nBlack Student Union\nand was general manager of student radio station\nKSFS\nand booked shows at\nThe Depot\n. His weekly “Turn Up at The Depot” event allowed student rappers (including himself), DJs and bands to perform alongside notable artists. He was having the time of his life and recorded an EP titled “19th and Holloway.”\n“There’s nothing like walking from Parkmerced to Stonestown late on a Friday night with your friends,” he said. “I wanted to capture that vibe in that EP. To this day, I still go back and listen to it and feel the same feels that I felt back then.”\nThe takeover\nA scholarship from Jay-Z’s\nShawn Carter Foundation\nhelped make it possible for Payton to attend SF State. When they met for an interview for “The Murder Inc. Story,” Jay-Z was so excited that he called his mother when the cameras stopped rolling: “Mom, look at this young man who we put through school! He is now working with BET!’”\nPayton is now working on a project for the Shawn Carter Foundation’s 20th anniversary. Payton is also slated to direct a docuseries about women’s contributions to hip-hop and executive produce a documentary about jailed drug lord Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff.\nPayton emphasizes that he aims for all of his work to be a catalyst for change and community involvement. “I always want to make sure we’re able to weave in things that are going to start necessary conversations,” said Payton, who earned his master’s degree from New York University and served as an executive fellow for the governor’s California Volunteers initiative. “It’s not just these people [who] made cool music and this cool thing they did. No, let’s also dig deeper into these stories of why and how and give that cultural context.”\nLearn more about the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department\n.\nSubscribe to Broadcast and Electronic Arts",

These rising stars bring a wealth and breadth of expertise to share with students in subjects as diverse as the University itself. They include a Comic Con-nominated artist, the co-editor of\nThe Feminist Porn Book\n, a member of the original Broadway cast of\nThe Lion King\n, a scholar of Jewish food and nostalgia and an expert on elections, voting and social movements.\nThe new professors are among 55 tenure-track and tenured faculty joining SF State this year.\nFatima Alaoui, Communication Studies\nAssistant Professor Fatima Alaoui’s research and teaching engage international and intercultural communication, critical rhetoric, media studies, political communication, gender studies and social change in a variety of contexts, including social movements, political discourse and pop culture.\nMore specifically, her scholarship considers how vernacular voices of resistance work to change their communities, with a focus on the Middle East and North Africa. The assistant professor also investigates issues of Arab and Muslim representation, performance and identity in the United States, Middle East and North Africa.\nAlaoui earned her Ph.D. from University of Denver. Her dissertation explored the vernacular discourse of the Arab spring. She was most recently a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies.\nOlivia Albiero, Italian/German\nAssistant Professor Olivia Albiero recently completed her doctorate in Germanics at University of Washington. She joined the university’s Germanics department in 2009 after completing a degree in modern Euro-American languages, literatures and cultures at University of Padua (Italy) and working as a language teaching assistant for Italian in Austria.\nAlbiero’s academic interests include German and Austrian literature from the late 19th to the 21st century, as well as narrative theory, crime fiction and intermediality. Her dissertation, “Moments of Rupture: Plotting, Character and Narration in Contemporary German Literature,” investigates storytelling and narrative practices in works of the 2000s.\nIlana Crispi, Art\nUsing ceramics, fiber and traditional craft along with contemporary technologies and junk materials, Assistant Professor Ilana Crispi creates excessively crafted objects and environments. Her creations are sometimes temporary and change over time. They occupy the gallery space and extend beyond to the street and sometimes into unexpected encounters. She makes sculptures and installations of the ephemeral: shadows and footprints and the impressions of stories. Her work often focuses on ideas of perception, the ways in which we perceive our environments and the things we desire.\nCrispi received an Eklind Fellowship and served as resident artist at the de Young and Legion of Honor museums in San Francisco and Rochester Folk Art Guild in New York. Her work has been shown at conventional and alternative sites including public streets in Oakland; Artists’ Television Access, Little Tree Gallery and the de Young Museum in San Francisco; Montalvo Arts Center in Saratoga; Children’s Discovery Museum in San Jose; and Shanghai Normal University Gallery in China. Her “Tenderloin Dirt Harvest” project was featured in The Atlantic and Juxtapoz.\nCrispi received her Master of Fine Arts from Mills College.\nMark Allan Davis, Theatre and Dance\nMark Allan Davis has choreographed many original dance and theatre works and taught and performed in more than 20 countries. He was an original cast member of the Tony Award-winning Broadway production of\nThe Lion King\n, where he performed on the Grammy Award-winning cast album. An active fundraiser for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, Davis wrote and directed several of\nThe Lion King\ncast’s benefit appearances, including\nBroadway Celebrates the Apollo\n.\nIn 1989 Davis formed his own company, Les Danses Dønsk in Munich, Germany.
