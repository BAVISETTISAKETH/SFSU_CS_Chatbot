Key criteria for potential partnerships include:\nStrong academic alignment (with sufficient coursework for SFSU students to participate for a year and make degree progress) in disciplines targeted for growth, such as speech pathology and public health\nA demonstrated ability to support balanced, sustainable inbound and outbound exchange\nComprehensive student support services, either through the international office or other campus service units\nLocations that broaden the geographic diversity of our outbound mobility offerings\nA recognized reputation for excellence and innovation in international education, with a sustained commitment to exchange\nA shared dedication to the values of diversity, equity, and social justice as core to the institutional mission\nPlease direct all inquires about establishing a new exchange program to Dr. Janelle Waldrep (\nwaldrep@sfsu.edu\n).\nAdditional information on SF State's guideline and protocol on establishing an international partnership is coming soon!",

Termination indicates that the student is “out of status” and will accrue unlawful presence while in the United States until status is regained. A record of unlawful presence may have a detrimental effect on future U.S. immigration.\nType of Addresses\nEach student should report two types of addresses:\nU.S. Mailing Address/Physical Address\nPermanent Address/Foreign Address\nThis is the student’s physical address in the U.S.\nThe mailing address should not be outside California.\nStudents living in on-campus housing must update their \"Mailing Address\" even if they have a \"Dormitory\" address in the Student Center.\nThis is the student’s permanent address outside the U.S. which was provided to SFSU during the admissions process.\nAn F-1 international and J-1 exchange student's permanent address cannot be an address\nIN\nthe U.S.\nStudents who wish to change their permanent address reach out to the\nSFSU Registrar's Office\nfor next steps.\nUpdating U.S. Mailing Address and Phone Number\nStep 1:\nLog in to the Student Center and scroll down to the “Personal Information” section. Click “Mailing Address” to update the U.S. mailing address or \"Home Phone\" to update the U.S. phone number:\nStep 2:\nClick “Edit” to enter the current U.S. mailing address or U.S. phone number.\nMake sure to click the “OK” button FIRST and then click “Save”.\nAdditional Information For F-1 International Students\n\"SEVIS Domestic Address\"\nThe SEVIS Domestic Address is the U.S. address associated with the student’s SEVIS record.

Students cannot manually update information in this field.\n\"SEVIS Foreign Address\"\nThe SEVIS Foreign Address is the foreign, permanent address associated with the student’s SEVIS record. When students update their permanent address with the Registrar’s Office, their SEVIS Foreign Address is automatically updated to reflect the same information.

Your emergency contact should be someone who knows you well and should be notified in case of an emergency. Remember to review and update this information regularly.\nNote:\nDo not list yourself as your own emergency contact.\nWe recommend that students provide at least two emergency contacts in the online Student Center:\nPrimary Contact:\nA family member, relative, friend, or partner in your home country.\nSecondary Contact:\nA backup contact in case the primary contact cannot be reached.

Students who fall below good academic standing will be placed on Academic Notice (Probation) and may be subject to Disqualification of Status. Academic Notice is generally associated with a GPA below 2.0.\nF-1 and J-1 students on Academic Notice or Subject to Disqualification can still maintain their immigration status as long as they are enrolled full-time and meet all other requirements. However, they may lose certain benefits, such as approval for on-campus employment, until they regain good academic standing. Additionally, students may be required to provide further documentation showing the steps they are taking to improve their academic standing (e.g., proof of attending tutoring, professors' office hours, etc.). Failure to comply with these requests may result in termination of their program.\nResources for Students on Academic Probation\nUndergraduate Students\n: Visit\nAcademic Notice | Advising Hub\nGraduate Students\n: Visit\nAcademic Notice/Probation | Division of Graduate Studies & Career Development\nImmigration Consequences\nF-1 international students who have been academically disqualified from SFSU will no longer be able to maintain their F-1 status at the university.

Alternatively, students may attach to their RCL form an original letter from the medical care provider (on the provider’s official letterhead) substantiating the student’s medical condition. Such a letter must contain a brief but detailed description of the student’s medical condition and recommend that the student enroll in either zero units or a part-time course load for the semester.\nThe student must resume full-time study in the next available Fall or Spring semester to maintain legal status unless a second RCL Due to Medical Condition is approved. A separate RCL Due to Medical Condition must be completed and approved each semester if more than one semester of RCL approval is required.\nJ-1 RCL Medical.pdf\n273.97 KB\nDeadlines:\nIf the student’s medical condition occurs before the beginning of the semester:\nRCL Due to Medical Condition must be approved by an exchange student advisor before the drop/add deadline.\nIf the student is enrolled full-time and a medical condition occurs during the current semester:\nThe student should contact a J-1 exchange student advisor as soon as possible. RCL Due to Medical conditions cannot be approved retroactively after the semester ends.

The adviser will assess the situation and notify the student of approval within 5 business days.\nReduced Course Load (RCL) Due to Academic Difficulty\nWho is Eligible?\nStudents may be eligible for Reduced Course Load (RCL) due to Academic Difficulty if they experience academic difficulties that prevent them from maintaining full-time enrollment.\nWhat to Know about RCL Due to Academic Difficulty\nFederal Immigration regulations define academic difficulty as Initial difficulty with English Language or reading requirements (first semester in the U.S. only); unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods (first semester in the U.S. only); or improper course placement. Eligible students MUST apply for RCL Due to Academic Difficulty before the add/drop deadline. RCL due to Academic Difficulty cannot be approved retroactively for previous semesters.\nStudents who wish to request RCL Due to Academic Difficulty must complete the RCL Due to Academic Difficulty form and must speak with a J-1 exchange student advisor at the Division of International Education first to verify eligibility. The RCL form must be approved by the student, exchange student advisor, and study abroad advisor at the student’s home university.\nJ-1 RCL Academics.pdf\n446.74 KB\nOnce RCL Du to Academic Difficulty has been approved, students must:\nRegister for a minimum of 6 units (for undergraduates) or 4 units (for graduates) in the approved semester AND\nResume full-time studies during the next available Fall or Spring semester in order to maintain legal status (only if studying at SFSU during the next semester).\nHow to request RCL Due to Academic Difficulty\nReview the RCL Due to Academic Difficulty information above.

With its focus on cross-cultural exchange, IEEC hosts internationally focused events, such as the Study Abroad Fair, and is a fantastic way to meet both fellow exchange students and U.S. students interested in international education and global issues.\nAs part of the SFSU Exchange Program, all J-1 exchange students contribute to IEEC through one of several available service commitments.\nAbout IEEC\nChanging IEEC Commitment\nJ-1 exchange students who will study at SFSU for two semesters may change their IEEC commitment in their second semester if they wish. Students interested in changing their IEEC commitment should contact\nexchange@sfsu.edu\nbefore the last day of the current semester. For example, if a student wishes to change to a new IEEC commitment in Spring, the request must be submitted before the last day of classes in the Fall semester.\nIn certain situations, students may be allowed to change their IEEC commitment during the semester. Students who wish to change their IEEC commitment during the semester must schedule an appointment to speak with an exchange student advisor.\n212(e) / Two-Year Home Residency Requirement\nSome J-1 Exchange Visitors are subject to\nSection 212(e) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n, also known as the Two-Year Home Residency Requirement or Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement. Students subject to the 212(e) must be physically present in their country of nationality or last legal permanent residence for at least two years (either consecutive or an aggregate) after completing their J-1 exchange program and leaving the United States before applying for certain U.S. visas or U.S. permanent residence.\nExchange students will be subject to the 212(e) in the following situations:\nThe student’s J-1 program was supported financially either directly or indirectly by the U.S. government or the government of the student’s home country.\nThe student’s J-1 subject area has been designated as a desirable skill by the government of the student’s home country (view the\nExchange Visitor Skills List\nfor additional information).\nStudents subject to the 212(e) will find this information reflected on their Form DS-2019 and J-1 visa.\nConsequences of the 212(e)\nA person subject to the 212(e) MAY NOT apply for the following U.S. visas until they have fulfilled the Two-Year Home Residency Requirement or obtained a waiver: H-1B temporary worker visa, L visa, K visa, or U.S. permanent residence.\nA person subject to the 212(e) MAY apply for the following U.S. visas before fulfilling the Two-Year Home Residency Requirement or obtaining a waiver: F-1 visa, J-1 visa, O-1 visa, B-1/B-2 visa, among others.\n212(e) Waiver\nStudents subject to the 212(e) may\nrequest a waiver\nfrom the U.S. State Department. Waivers are granted only in certain circumstances, and the Division of International Education is unable to assist J-1 exchange students or scholars with the waiver process.\nJ-1 visa holders with questions about the 212(e) / Two-Year Home Residency Requirement should contact an exchange student advisor at the Division of International Education.\nDS-2019 Extension\nStudents approved to extend their period of study or participate in Academic Training immediately after their studies end will receive a new DS-2019 with extended program dates that meet the duration needed to complete their additional period of study or Academic Training. Please see Academic Training information at\nEmployment\nsection for further information.\nIf students wish to extend their period of study for an additional semester, they must first speak to an Exchange Advisor no later than November 1, 2024\nJ-2 Dependents\nA J-1 visa holder’s spouse and/or children (21 and under) can accompany them during their program in the United States by entering the country in J-2 dependent status. J-2 dependents may legally remain in the United States as long as the primary (J-1) visa holder maintains legal status.\nWhat to Know about J-2 Status\nDuration:\nThe duration of a J-2 visa holder’s right to remain in the United States may not exceed the length of the associated J-1 visa holder’s program. Additionally, a J-2 visa holder’s right to remain in the United States may be extended if the associated J-1 visa holder’s program is extended. When the associated J-1 visa holder completes their program and leaves the United States, any J-2 dependents must leave as well.\nGrace period:\nLike J-1 visa holders, J-2 visa holders receive a 30-day grace period after the end date on their DS-2019. During the grace period, J-2 visa holders may travel within the United States, but they may not leave and re-enter the United States with their expired DS-2019 immigration documents.\nHealth Insurance:\nAs with J-1 visa holders participating in a program at SFSU, J-2 dependents must purchase and maintain SFSU-specified health insurance for the duration of their program.\nEmployment:\nJ-2 visa holders may be authorized for employment by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for the duration of the associated J-1 visa holders program as indicated on their DS-2019 or a period of four years, whichever is shorter. To work, J-2 dependents must apply for and obtain a Social Security Number. J-2 dependents who work are subject to federal and local income tax.\nJ-1 visa holders with questions about J-2 ",

It's important to realize that SF State does not provide financial assistance or cover the expected cost of attendance for international students. In addition, there is no U.S. financial aid or international student scholarships available to cover international students' studies at SF State.\nBudget\nIt's essential to plan and budget accordingly, ensuring you have the necessary funds to cover tuition and fees, health insurance, housing/food/living expenses, books, and school supplies, technology for school, travel/transportation/commuting expenses, and any other expenses while attending SF State.\nExpected Expenses v.s. Actual Expenses\nFinally, while F-1 and J-1 students may have demonstrated financial readiness for tuition and living costs to receive the I-20 and DS-2019, it's crucial to recognize that unforeseen expenses can arise upon arrival. The true cost of studying at SF State varies for each student. It's essential to be financially prepared to handle these circumstances independently.\nPlan a Budget\nLiving Expenses in San Francisco\nSan Francisco has the highest cost of living of any city in the United States. The majority of students' money will go toward educational expenses, food, rent, utilities, and other personal expenses. Students can determine their educational expenses based on the expected costs of tuition and course materials, such as books, access codes, and supplies. The average cost of rent in San Francisco ranges from $2,100 to $6,300, so most students live with roommates to reduce this cost.\nStudents should take this into consideration before coming to San Francisco and evaluate the amount of funding they will need to live comfortably and safely in the city. When budgeting, prioritize funds for educational purposes, rent, utilities, food, and other essential expenses—plus a small emergency fund, if possible.\nPlan a Budget\nTo maintain financial wellness, begin by creating a budget and do your best to follow it. Additionally:\nUnderstand your income and expenses: Understanding your expenses and how much income you have available through work, scholarships, family, etc., may sound basic, but it is essential information for planning your budget.\nCreate a budget: Write a list of expected expenses and set a limit on how much money you will spend each month on each expense. If your budget is tight, determine the difference between \"wants\" and \"needs.\" This may sound strict, but knowing exactly how much money you have left over after necessary expenses will help you feel less guilty when spending on things you want, as you'll know you can afford them.\nFollow your budget: Once you have a budget in place, do your best to adhere to it. A budget isn't useful unless you use it!\nHere are some helpful resources to assist students with budgeting:\nSF State Abroad - SF Exchange Program Budget - YouTube\nStudent Budgeting Tips and College Saving Guide\n6 Money Mistakes College Students Make\nCampus Financial Literacy Initiatives\nBank Accounts\nIn addition to general financial planning, students must decide whether to stick with their bank account in their home country or open a temporary one in the U.S. To open a bank account, students should research banks' student account options and contact them regarding their interest.\nTo learn more about banking in the United States, please visit\nthis resource\n.\nInternational Students Financial Literacy Workshop\nTopics\nExpected expenses while studying at SF State\nExpenses due each semester\nHow to plan a budget (Google Sheets)\nDownload the worksheet\nPlan ahead! due date timeline for Spring and Fall\nFinancial resources\nNext steps\nMaterials\nRecordings:\nInternational Students Financial Literacy\n(Length: 16:21)\nPresentation slides:\nInternational Students Financial Literacy (Google Slides)\nFree budget worksheet:\nSample International Student Budget Worksheet (Link to Google Sheets)\n(Download as Microsoft Excel or make a copy for yourself)\nFinancial Assistance\nFor international students venturing abroad for education, navigating financial constraints can be a daunting task. Limited financial resources, coupled with the unfamiliarity of a new country's financial landscape, present unique challenges.\nWe advise all international students to seek and secure financial resources in their home countries before arriving in the U.S. If students wish to seek financial resources in the U.S. after exhausting all financial resources in their home country, below is a list of various financial resources to explore:\nThe following resources is courtesy of\nNAFSA: Financial Aid for Undergraduate International Students\nFunding Sources: Web Sites with Multiple Scholarship Resources\nScholarships | San Francisco State Office of Student Financial Aid\nSan Francisco State Scholarships\nScholarship - Study California\nCollege Board\nFree online financial aid source for scholarships, grants, and loans for all college-bound students, including permanent residents and international students wishing to study in the United States.\nScholarship Finder\nSearchable database of scholarships, fellowships, grants and other financial aid opportunities.

Many loans require a cosigner. A cosigner is someone who guarantees and is responsible for payment to the loaning institution if for any reason you are unable to pay back the loan. A variety of organizations and institutions provide private loans to international students. Many provide assistance that is targeted to students from specific regions or countries and who meet certain criteria.\nWhen considering taking out a student loan from any private organization or institution, do thorough research and compare the rates and terms offered by various loan providers. Interest rates, repayment terms, loan maximums, and fees can vary significantly between lenders. Carefully review all terms and conditions, and strongly consider seeking advice from a financial advisor or student loan expert to ensure you make an informed decision. These preemptive steps will help secure the best possible loan for your needs.\nInterest-Free Loans\nThe\nOrganization of American States\n, an international organization based in Washington, DC offers, through the Rowe Fund program, interest-free loans to competent students from Latin American and Caribbean countries to help them finance their graduate, postgraduate, and final two years of undergraduate studies at accredited universities within the United States. For more information and to download the forms, see\nhttps://www.oas.org/en/rowefund\nor e-mail the Rowe Fund Program at\nrowefund@oas.org\n.\nOn-Campus Employment*\nHandshake (joinhandshake.com)\nOn-campus employment\n*International and Exchange students can not rely on employment to cover their entire expenses during their studies at SF State.\nTaxes in the U.S.\nGetting Tax Advice\nStudents are encouraged to contact the\nVolunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA)\nfor tax preparation assistance.\nIncome Tax\nAll international students, scholars, and their dependents present in the U.S. during any part of the previous calendar year must file annual tax forms between January 1 and April 15 with the\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS)\n. This rule applies even to those who did not work or earn income in the U.S. during the previous year.\nTax forms are available at most banks and post offices and can be downloaded from the\nU.S. Government Services and Information website\n. Detailed instructions accompany these forms.\nBecause of the complexity of income tax laws, it is advisable to have tax questions answered by the IRS or by a reliable tax consultant.\nThe Division of International Education cannot offer tax advice.\nWhy File a Tax Return?\nStudents authorized to work for pay during their studies at SF State will typically be required by their employer to complete Tax Withholding paperwork.* The employer uses this paperwork to determine how much money in taxes should be withheld from the student’s paychecks or other taxable income, such as stipend payments. Filing a tax return allows the U.S. government to determine whether the employee paid too much or too little in taxes. Employees who paid too much in taxes will receive a refund, while employees who paid too little will be required to pay a specified amount to the U.S. government.\n*Students should tell their employer their immigration status (F-1, J-1, H-1B, permanent resident, etc.) for taxation purposes.\nNo Income Tax Filing - Form 8843\nIf students are International students in F-1 student visa status and have no income, they must file\nForm 8843 “Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition\"\n.  Social security numbers are not required to file Form 8843.  Form 8843 is not an income tax return. It is merely an informational statement required by the U.S. government for international students (including the spouses or dependents of nonresident aliens).\nIncome Tax Filing - Get Assistance from VITA\nStaff at the Division of International Education is neither qualified nor permitted to give individual tax advice. Students with complicated tax situations may wish to consult with a tax preparation service, professional tax accountant, or tax attorney who is knowledgeable about nonresident tax law.\nThe Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program (VITA) at San Francisco State University provides free tax return preparation assistance. SF State’s VITA program is sponsored by the IRS and the University’s Beta Alpha Psi - Beta Chi Chapter, an international honor society for business majors.\nOther Tax Resources\nFree Tax Bay Area:\nhttps://uwba.org/freetaxhelp/\nState of California:\nhttps://www.ftb.ca.gov/help/free-tax-help/VITA_Locator/\nIRS:\nhttps://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/\nLiving in the City\nHousing in San Francisco\nFinding a safe, secure housing is a crucial step to preparing for a successful experience at SF State. The average rent in San Francisco is currently $2000 or more per month for a studio apartments, and $3000 or more for one-bedroom apartments.\nSee current San Francisco rent research at\nAverage Rent in San Francisco, CA and Cost Information - Zumper\n.\nThough San Francisco's rental prices are high, there are still lower-budget options available to students. Students are advised to read the following information below before starting their housing search.\nOn-Campus Housing\nApply for on-campus housing for Spring 2025 at\nhttps://housing.sfsu.edu/apply\nas soon as possible and secure your spot in a vibrant and supportive living community. SF State University Housing is excited to offer guaranteed housing for all international\nfirst-time freshmen\n, ensuring you have a comfortable and convenient place to call home while you focus on your studies. Transfer students and graduate students are also encouraged to apply!\nWhile assignments are based on availability, we are pleased to announce that housing options are available. Don't miss out on the chance to live in the heart of campus.\nYou do not need to wait until you are admitted to apply for on-campus housing. Once students receive an SF State student ID and password, they are eligible to complete the online housing application.\nOff-Campus Housing\nIf students wish to live off-campus, they may find\nOff-Campus Housing resources\nto be useful. New students can also find SF State-specific Facebook groups where they can post and respond to messages regarding housing and connect with other SF State students who are looking for roommates.\nHouses and apartments in San Francisco come in various architectural styles (Victorian, modern, etc.) and sizes (studios, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, etc.) and may come unfurnished or furnished. There are many off-campus living options common in San Francisco:\nSharing an apartment or house with roommates of their choice\nRenting an apartment by themselves\nRenting a room from tenants in an established household with shared common areas (“sublet”)\nRenting a room with an American family (“homestay”)\nTemporary Housing after Arriving in San Francisco\nIt is often easier for students to find long-term housing in San Francisco after they have arrived in the city. For this reason, the Division of International Education recommends that students arrange temporary housing before arriving in San Francisco and then look for more permanent housing after they have arrived in San Francisco. This ensures that they have somewhere to stay upon arrival while looking for long-term accommodations.\nThe Division of International Education is not able to assist students in finding temporary or long-term housing. If you do not have a friend or relative in the area to stay with, booking a hostel or hotel in advance is the best option.\nPlease note that it can take one to three weeks to find permanent off-campus housing, so it is best to arrange temporary housing that meets that timeline.\nIt is not a good idea to try to find permanent housing immediately after getting off a plane, with your luggage, and no knowledge of the city.\nHouse Hunting Tips\nKnow the Neighborhood\nThe best way to determine where to live is to spend some time there. Get a meal, go to a café, and walk or bike around to get a sense of what a neighborhood is like before committing to live there.\nSee\nSan Francisco Neighborhood Guide\nfor more information.\nDon’t Rush\nAlthough we understand what a stressful time the first few weeks in San Francisco can be between orientation, the beginning of the semester, and house hunting, don’t feel compelled to take the very first apartment you see. When possible, it is better to take more time to find a living situation knowing it will be comfortable. Taking time will help to get a better sense of which neighborhoods potentially to live in, and after visiting a few different places, it will allow you to get a better idea of standard prices for different types of accommodation in the Bay Area.\nGet it in Writing\nIn order to be protected from scams and less-than-honest landlords/master tenants, it is a good idea to document all the details of the living situation as soon as an agreement is reached. For example, if the landlord or new roommate (master tenant) quotes a monthly rent which includes the cost for water and utilities, have them write up a contract stating the conditions of the lease for each resident before moving in. Keep a copy of this contract in case a dispute occurs.\nBeware of Scams\nSee the Recognizing Scams and Fraud Section below for more information.\nBe Cautious\nIf a landlord or potential housemate/roommate seems untrustworthy, asks for bizarre documents that you would be uncomfortable providing, or gives you a general bad feeling, do not rent that apartment or room.\nTypically, your instincts in those situations are correct.\nLike many big cities, San Francisco has landlords that may not be reliable. Although there are plenty of rights and protections that you have as a tenant, we do not want students to have an unpleasant living experience or tense relations with roommates or landlords while being here.\nFind support with the San Francisco Tenants' Union\nThe\nSan Francisco Tenants' Union\nis a community organization that exists as a resource for tenants to help them learn about their rights concerning housing issues such as security deposits, evictions, landlord harassment, roommates, repairs, rent increases, etc. It is important to know your rights in order to be protected if necessary.\nAdvice from current International Students\n\"Get to San Francisco a week before orientation to start looking for housing because looking during orientation week can be stressful.\"\n\"Find a cheap hostel to stay in for a while if no housing is found.\"\n\"Find a house in a well-connected area (in terms of public transportation).\"\n\"Make sure to find comfortable housing to feel at home—that is important! I was terribly homesick until I moved; now, I don’t want to leave!\"\n\"Start looking for a home before getting to San Francisco.\"\n\"Look for housing early, and do not despair if it does not go well in a week; every day brings better opportunities.\"\n\"Live with roommates, not alone.\"\nWhat to Do When Sick?\nDownload this \"Help! I Need Medical Care\" handout.  Also visit the \"Seek Medical Help\" section in Health Insurance Requirement & U.S. Health Care.\nHelp!

    "content": "Health Insurance Requirement & U.S. Health Care\nWhat Students Need to Know\nWhy is Health Insurance Mandatory?\nThe Cost of Medical Care is High in the U.S.\nUnlike many countries, the United States does not provide “universal access” or “national health care”.  International students are also not eligible for any U.S. federal welfare assistance. When international students receive medical care in the U.S., the doctors and hospitals will look to international students and their insurance companies to get paid for their services.\nAccording to\nHealthCare.gov\n, fixing a broken leg can cost up to $7,500, and the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000.\nWithout insurance, international students might face financial ruin resulting from serious accidents or illness. This could prevent them from completing studies in the U.S.\nIt is CSU Enrollment Requirement\nF-1 International Students\nThe Board of Trustees of the California State University (CSU) requires F-1 international students to have health insurance as a condition of class registration at SFSU.\nJ-1 Exchange Students\nAs per J-1 immigration regulations and the above-mentioned CSU policy, all exchange students on J-1 visas and J-2 dependents must maintain health insurance coverage for the duration of their program as indicated on the Form DS-2019.\nUnderstand Student Insurance Coverage\nThe insurance company for the 2025-2026 academic year is\nUnited HealthCare.\nIn some cases, students may be required to pay a “co-pay” to receive a service. Additionally, some non-essential services, such as cosmetic surgery, may not be covered.\nInsurance Coverage During Summer and Winter Break\nF-1 International Students\nF-1 international students are not required to maintain full-time enrollment in the summer session or Winter break.\nStudents may purchase the SFSU pre-approved insurance plan through in summer if they enroll in the following Fall semester.\nF-1 international students who are not enrolled in Summer:\nStudents who are not enrolled in Summer may choose not to purchase insurance\nThe Division of International Education recommends students to purchase some other form of short-term health insurance to protect their health, safety, and financial wellness.\nJ-1 Exchange Students\nAll J-1 exchange students, research scholars on J-1 visas, and J-2 dependents\nMUST\nmaintain health insurance coverage for the duration of their program as indicated by the dates on their Form DS-2019 (this includes the Summer Term for Calendar Year students).\nExchange visitors who “willfully fail” to maintain the required health insurance coverage are in violation of their J-1 status and are subject to termination.\nAdditional Voluntary Dental and Vision Plan\nRoutine (meaning non-emergency) dental and vision care are NOT covered by the SFSU pre-approved insurance plan.\nStudents who would like this coverage should purchase additional dental and/or vision insurance or be prepared to pay for such services privately. Dental and/or vision insurance is not required by SFSU. Students may use other dental and vision insurance services if they wish.\nVoluntary Dental/Vision\nSee Voluntary Dental/Vision insurance information at United HealthCare's Student Resouces page:\nhttps://www.uhcsr.com/voluntary-dentalvision\nAffordable dental clinics near SFSU\nPotrero Hill Health Center\n1050 Wisconsin Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\n415-648-3022\nWeb:\nhttps://sfhealthnetwork.org/about-sfhn/do-you-need-a-dentist/\nUCSF General Dentistry Student Clinic\n707 Parnassus Avenue Suite D-4000\nSan Fransico, CA 94143\n415-476-1891\nWeb:\nhttps://www.ucsfdentalcenter.org/clinics/student-general-dentistry-clinic-parnassus\nInsurance Exceptions (F-1 International Students)\nExceptions\nThe following students may be exempt from purchasing the SFSU pre-approved insurance plan:\nF-1 international students on government-sponsored scholarships that provide compatible insurance coverage as a part of the sponsorship. Contact\nf1@sfsu.edu\nfor instructions.\nF-1 international students receiving insurance coverage through an employer-sponsored plan\nin the United States\n(i.e., receipt of insurance as part of a spouse's U.S. employment benefits).\nThis exception does not apply to F-1 students who are receiving employer-sponsored plans from their\nCPT employers.\nInstructions\nFollow the steps below:\nStep 1: Prepare proof of insurance\nObtain an electronic copy of your Summary of Benefits and Proof of Insurance, which should include your name on the policy and eligibility dates.\nStep 2: Purchase the repatriation/evacuation insurance\nSFSU requires all F-1 international students to purchase repatriation/evacuation insurance to ensure they have the resources necessary to return to their home country in the event of a catastrophic event or to have their remains returned to their country should an accident occur resulting in a student's death. F-1 students are in non-immigrant status and are therefore subject to this requirement. Contact\nf1@sfsu.edu\nfor the link to purchase repatriation/evacuation insurance.\nStep 3: Complete the waiver\nContact\nf1@sfsu.edu\nto obtain the link for a Health Insurance Waiver Application on DocuSign. When signing the application, students must upload their summary of benefits, proof of insurance, and proof of repatriation/evacuation insurance.\nUnderstand the 2025-2026 Insurance Plan\nRecommended Reading\nHealth Insurance 101 | UnitedHealthcare Student Resources (uhcsr.com)\nGlossary | UnitedHealthcare Student Resources (uhcsr.com)\nVideo Resources\nVisit United HealthCare's student resources page at\nhttps://www.uhcsr.com/video\n.\nStudents will find short videos on many subjects from Insurance education to a library of Mental Health and Substance Abuse videos, to specific My Account “How to” videos.\nLearn How to Use Your Student Insurance\nSee:\nFrequently Asked Questions | UnitedHealthcare Student Resources (uhcsr.com)\nPurchase Health Insurance\nHealth Insurance Requirement\nF-1 international students, J-1 exchange students, and J-1 research scholars must purchase and maintain SFSU pre-approved international student health insurance.\nStudents may purchase additional insurance policies if they wish, but they must purchase the international health insurance plan pre-approved by SFSU regardless.\nNEW!

Certain services are provided \"at cost\" which means that students must pay but at a lower-than-average price.\nImportant: GSHC is NOT a walk-in clinic. Before accessing GSHC services, students must first make an appointment. Students can schedule an appointment by following instructions on the GSHC website.\nStudents will have to pay no-show fees if they do not come to the appointment.\nUsing Student Health Insurance at GSHC\nStudents are required to pay for GSHC services first at the Student Center, then file a claim with insurance company to be reimbursed (paid back).\nTo pay for the medical services received at GSHC: Log on to the Student Center and make payment, just like how they pay for tuition and fees every semester.\nFall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025: See United HealthCare at\nhttp://www.uhcsr.com/sfsu\nOff-Campus Health Care\nMany off-campus healthcare options are available. Students must understand what each type of healthcare facility offers and when to use them.\nOff-Campus Clinics\nStudents who wish to receive a general medical check-up or non-urgent medical care that is not available at GSHC may make a doctor’s appointment at an off-campus clinic that offers general or specialized medical care for a specific health concern.\nTo find an off-campus doctors (aka \"providers\")\nFall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025: See United HealthCare at\nhttp://www.uhcsr.com/sfsu\nUrgent Care vs. Emergency Room\nIMPORTANT: Students should NOT go to the Emergency Room unless they have a life-threatening illness or injury.\nUrgent Care\nUrgent Care is a type of walk-in clinic that treats injuries or illnesses that are non-life-threatening but still require immediate attention (e.g. flu, cold, sprained ankle). Students do not need an appointment to visit an Urgent Care clinic.\nStudents should visit Urgent Care in the following situations:\nThey cannot get an appointment with GSHC but feel that they must see a doctor immediately.\nAn Urgent Care clinic is more conveniently located than GSHC.\nThe student wishes to receive medical care that is not listed on the GSHC website.\nSee the below for more details about how to find an Urgent Care clinic.\nEmergency Room\nThe emergency room should ONLY be used for life-threatening situations\n(such as those that require an ambulance). Students who need to go to the emergency room due to life-threatening injury or illness should call campus police at 415.338.2222 (if on campus) or 911 for help.\nStudents should NOT visit the emergency room for non-life-threatening situations.\nIf students use the emergency room in a non-emergency situation, their health insurance may not cover the cost of the healthcare that they receive.\nFor mild to moderate illnesses and injuries, SFSU recommends that students visit Urgent Care or make an appointment with an in-network doctor. Use the Help! I Need Medical Care chart below to learn when to visit the emergency room.\nHelp! I Need Medical Care Flyer.pdf\n234.21 KB\nFinding a Doctor \"In-Network\"\nWhen making an appointment with an off-campus doctor, students should be aware of the difference between “\nin-network\n” and “\nout-of-network\n” healthcare providers.\nAn\nin-network\nprovider is a provider that will accept students’ insurance, while an \"\nout-of-network\n\" provider will not. For this reason, in-network providers are more affordable.\nUnderstanding Health Insurance\nTips for Using Insurance\nTo use their insurance properly, students should:\nGet familiar with insurance benefits.\nTry to find an off-campus doctor (aka healthcare provider) and an urgent care clinic. Get an idea of where the healthcare facilities are around you.\nCarry the health insurance ID card with them all the time, especially when attending an appointment or visiting a walk-in clinic.\nIf applicable, pay the “co-pay” at the beginning of the appointment. When checking in, students should ask if the healthcare provider will bill the insurance company directly for the remaining cost OR if the student must \"file a claim\".\nFile a claim (if needed).\nWho Can Help?\nFall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025:\nContact United HealthCare enrollment at 1-800-767-0700 or email\ncustomerservice@uhcsr.com\n.\nFrequently Used Insurance Terms\nWhat is a “co-pay”?\nA \"co-pay\" is a fixed fee that the student must pay for certain services at the beginning of an in-network medical appointment. Insurance will cover the remaining cost. Review the plan summary to learn which medical services have a co-pay.\nWhat is a \"deductible\"?\nA \"deductible\" is the set amount of money a student must spend on certain medical services before insurance will begin to cover the cost. Once the deductible is met, insurance will cover a percentage of the cost through a process called \"coinsurance\". Review the plan summary to learn which medical services have a deductible.\nWhat is “coinsurance”?\nIf a student reaches the deductible limit for a deductible-eligible service, insurance will begin to pay for a percentage of the cost, while the student is responsible for the rest of the cost. This process is referred to as \"coinsurance.\"\nWhile a \"co-pay\" is a fixed rate for service with no deductible, \"coinsurance\" is a percentage of the total bill that the students pays after reaching their deductible.\nWhat does it mean to “file a claim”?\nNormally, when students use their health insurance to receive medical care, the medical provider will send the bill directly to the insurance company. However, at some locations (for example, Student Health Services at SFSU), the medical clinic will bill the patient. The patient must pay the bill and then \"file a claim\" with the insurance company to receive a reimbursement, if eligible.\nFor more details about how to file a claim, visit the “Claims” section under “Use Your Insurance\" on the\nhttps://sfsu.mycare26.com/\nHealth Insurance FAQ\nWill my health insurance cover a flu shot?\nOur plan offers preventative care, including flu shots for in-network providers. SFSU’s\nStudent Health Services\noffers affordable flu shots periodically during the semester.\nWhat do I say when a healthcare provider asks what kind of insurance I have?\nFor Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025, your insurance company is United HealthCare.\nWho do I contact if I have a question about my coverage or a bill I have received?\nFor specific questions about medical benefits and claims or support finding an in-network provider, contact\nFor Fall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025: contact United HealthCare enrollment at 1-800-767-0700 or email\ncustomerservice@uhcsr.com\n.\nWill my insurance cover “___”?\nIf a student is not sure what is covered by their health insurance plan, they may do the following:\nFall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025: contact United HealthCare enrollment at 1-800-767-0700 or email\ncustomerservice@uhcsr.com\n.\nWill my insurance cover the care I receive at Gator Student Health Center (GSHC)?\nStudents who receive bills from GSHC should pay the bill and then file a claim to receive reimbursement, if eligible.\nThe U.S. health insurance industry uses a lot of confusing vocabulary. Where can I look up terms that I don’t understand?\nFall 2024, Spring 2025, and Summer 2025: contact United HealthCare enrollment at 1-800-767-0700 or email\ncustomerservice@uhcsr.com\n.\nQuick Links\nCurrent Students\nVisa and Immigration\nMaintaining Status\nU.S. Employment Authorization\nTravel\nNew Students\nImportant Dates\nPre-Arrival Checklist\nOrientation\nOther Resources\nHealth Insurance Requirement and U.S. Health Care\nLife in San Francisco\nWellness & Academic Success\nContact an Advisor\nLast updated:\nOctober 2025\nTo view PDF files, you'll need Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or above to view it.

Students may not begin any employment prior to receiving work authorization. This section covers the various types of employment eligibility students may seek in J-1 or F-1 status. It is students’ responsibility to understand their on- and off-campus work eligibility.\nAll Students\nOn-Campus Employment\nWith authorization, eligible F-1 and J-1 students may work on campus as student assistants, tutors, teaching assistants, etc.\nSF State student employees may work up to 20 hours per week (part-time) during the Spring and Fall semesters and up to 40 hours per week (full-time) during Summer sessions and semester breaks.\nSee\nOn-Campus Employment\n>>\nVolunteering and Unpaid Internships\nRules governing volunteering and unpaid internships are complex, as this is an area where immigration regulations and labor laws intersect.\nStudents must understand relevant regulations so that they do not violate any laws by participating in unauthorized employment.\nSee\nVolunteering and Unpaid Internships\n>>\nSocial Security Number (SSN)\nA Social Security Number (SSN) is not a U.S. work authorization.\nEven if an international or exchange student already has an SSN, it does not imply that the student has U.S. work authorization. In essence, an SSN does not verify the eligibility of international or exchange students to work in the U.S.\nSSN  is primarily intended to identify participants in the U.S. federal government's Social Security Program. SSNs are generally assigned to people who are authorized to work in the U.S. and are used to report their wages to the government.\nSee\nSocial Security Number (SSN)\n>>\nCareer and Leadership Development\nCareer & Leadership Development (CLD) equips SF State's diverse student and alumni population with modern resources that assist, guide, and foster their leadership, professional, and career advancement.\nSee\nCareer and Leadership Development\n>>\nJ-1 Exchange Students Only\nAcademic Training\nAcademic Training allows eligible J-1 exchange students to gain work experience in their field of study (as it appears on the student’s DS-2019) by participating in off-campus internships and employment opportunities.\nSee\nAcademic Training for J-1 Students\n>>\nEconomic Hardship\nJ-1 exchange students may request off-campus work authorization in the event of lost exchange program funding. Loss of funding must result from unforeseen circumstances outside the student's control.

    "content": "Completing Study at SFSU\n“One’s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.”\n~Henry Miller, Writer\nPrepare to Return Home\nPay any Outstanding Balance on the Student Center\nPaying SF State Bills\nPay any outstanding\ncampus financial obligations\nsuch as tuition, housing fees, and library fines. Pay parking fines if students have received tickets.\nLog on to the Student Center via\nSF State Gateway\nto see the outstanding balances.\nBanking\nIf students have opened up a bank account in the U.S. and do not plan to keep it, students must make sure to communicate with their bank to close their account and transfer their money.\nPhone Bills\nIf students have a U.S. phone number with a U.S. phone carrier, students must make sure to cancel their plan in order to avoid being charged for the number. If they would like to keep the number, explore options to keep it, such as transferring it to an\nonline phone number\n.\nUtilities/Other\nIf students have their name on any utility or other bills (such as water, electricity, internet, etc), students must make sure to end it or transfer it to their roommates, so that they are not liable for any charges.\nSelling or Shipping Belongings\nFurniture, Car, Clothes, Other Personal Belongings\nStudents will have to decide what items they would like to sell or ship to their home country. When communicating with international shipping companies, inquire about cost, size/weight, insurance, and estimated shipping time.\nBooks & School Work\nStudents should reach out to their friends and classmates to see if they can sell some of their books.\nSF State bookstore\nmay buy back some books.\nNote that some Graduate Programs ask for writing samples; if students are interested in graduate school, they may consider keeping copies of some of their schoolwork for reference.\nMoving Out of Housing\nMove Out Notice\nIf students' leases are ending and/or if they are not on a lease, they will need to consider when is the best time to tell their landlord that they are moving out. The typical time frame is a 30 day notice.\nFinal Walk-Through\nIf students live off-campus they probably paid a security deposit to their landlord to cover any damage done to the apartment. A walk-through will help them and their landlord agree on whether their landlord should keep any of their security deposit.\nKeep in Touch With Friends\nFriends\nStudents' friends may stay in the U.S. or leave and return to their home countries; they will have personal and professional connections all over the world if they maintain these bridges. Take time to reach out to people and connect with each other.\nOther SF State Students\nJust because students did not connect during their studies, does not mean they cannot afterward; the\nSF State Alumni network\nis available for them to keep in touch with the university and other alumni.\nDid students receive help from someone else when they were at SF State? Are they hoping to give back and be the help they wanted as a student?\nGator Connect\nis an online platform that connects alumni with current students to have career conversations and build professional networks.\nFaculty / Staff\nStudents should take time to reflect and consider if any faculty or staff made an impact in their educational journey, either professional, academic, or personal. Reach out to these people to let them know. It is nice to feel appreciated and it is nice to keep a connection, so if they ever need an academic reference for graduate school, they already have some people in mind.\nF-1 International Students\nAcademic Considerations\nMaking Sure Students Are Eligible to Graduate\nDo not forget to apply for graduation!\nUndergraduate students apply through the\nRegistrar's Office\n. Contact the college-based student advising/resource/success centers (See\nAcademic Advising Directory\n)\nGraduate students apply through\nGraduate Studies\n. Contact the\ngraduate coordinators\nUpdate your Diploma Address on your Student Center (see\nDiploma Information\n)\nInternational students are required to pursue full-time study in the programs indicated on their I-20s. It is possible to take additional classes for personal enrichment BEFORE students complete the program on their I-20, but not after.\nSave Copies of Academic Records\nSF State Student emails are closed after a student graduates.\nStudents should ensure their preferred personal email is up to date in their Student Center.\nStudents should forward any information they would like to keep, such as address book information, course syllabus, projects and papers.\nStudents should set forwarding addresses and or accounts that utilize SF State emails to their personal emails.\nStudents will lose access to their Student Services Center beyond one year after graduation.\nStudents should download copies of unofficial transcripts for personal references.\nBeyond one year after graduation, students must request official transcripts (payment required) if they wish to access transcripts.\nF-1 Status Considerations (60-day Grace Period)\nWhat is the 60-Day Grace Period?\nStudents are eligible for a 60-day grace period starting from the “\nGrades Available on SF State Gateway\n” date posted on the Registrar's website.  This does not apply if they have applied for OPT.\nWhat Can Students Do During the Grace Period?\nIf students have applied or will apply for OPT:\nOnce they apply for OPT, they may stay in the U.S. on \"Pending OPT\" status as long as their case is pending. Once their OPT is approved, they may stay in the U.S. on \"Approved\" OPT status. Students are not using their 60-day grace period in this case. We recommend students apply for OPT 90 days before the “\nGrades Available on SF State Gateway\n” date.\nPlease follow the OPT website for application deadlines. Review all of the information to learn about the processing time, unemployment days, how to choose a start date, and what documents to submit to us.\nIf students are interested in OPT and traveling after graduation, they should talk to an F-1 international student advisor before booking their flights.\nIf students plan to pursue another academic program in the U.S. right after graduating from SF State\nIf students wish to attend another academic program in the U.S., they must contact the Division of International Education and request their SEVIS record to be released to their new school within their 60-day grace period. There is no exception to this rule. Students should follow I-20 Transfer Procedures so the Division of International Education can release their SEVIS record to their new school.\nIf students plan to transfer to another academic program here at SF State they will have to receive an I-20 with their new academic program.\nIf students will not apply for OPT and/or transfer to another school\nStudents will not need to do anything regarding their F-1 status.  They should plan to leave the U.S. before their 60-day grace period ends.\nStudents' SEVIS record and their I-20 will automatically change from “Active” status to “Completed” status upon the end of their 60-day grace period.\nStudents are not allowed to work or take a course if they are not on OPT or not transferring to another school.\nHow Long Can Students Continue to Work on Campus?\nStudents are allowed to work on-campus up to the “Semester End Date” posted on the\nAcademic Calendar\nfor the semester that they are graduating. There are no exceptions even if they have applied for OPT.\nDomestic students are allowed to work during the summer after graduation, but F-1 international students may not due to immigration restrictions. Their on-campus employer may not be aware of this restriction for F-1 international students, so students need to let their on-campus employer know about this immigration restriction for F-1 students.\nCan Students Leave the U.S. and Return During the Grace Period?\nBefore traveling\nStudents must decide if they are interested in applying for OPT.\nThey must apply for OPT before they leave the country during their 60-day grace period.\nIf they will leave the U.S, students should book their flight back home early so they have a deadline of when they must leave. We recommend students to not wait until the very last day to fly home. If there are any flight delays due to weather or other reasons, their F-1 records will automatically complete and they will not have a valid F-1 status to stay in the U.S.\nStudents must check to make sure their Passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond their desired travel date.  They might not be able to board the plane if they do not have a valid passport.\nTraveling within the U.S. during the 60 day grace period\nF-1 International Students are allowed to travel within the U.S. during their grace period. They do not need a signature on their I-20 to travel domestically.\nDepending on where their future takes them, it may be a little while before they will return to SF State, San Francisco, or the Bay Area. Students should try to re-visit some of the places they will miss! Also, students should take advantage of their free time and visit the different cities in the U.S. that they have always wanted to see!\nTravel outside of the U.S. during the 60 day grace period\nIf students leave the U.S. during their grace period, their SEVIS record will be automatically completed, and they will not be able to re-enter the U.S. on their I-20.\nFor example, Alice’s program ends on June 3, and her 60-day grace period will begin on June 4. Alice has decided to go to Canada for a week (June 15 to June 25) and wants to return to the U.S. to move out of her apartment by June 30, her housing lease end date. If Alice leaves the country on June 15, she will not be able to return to the U.S. on June 26 after her trip to Canada, because she left the country during her grace period.\nIf students are interested in OPT and traveling after graduation, they should talk to an F-1 international student advisor before booking their flights.\nEmployment Opportunities in the U.S.\nStudents have access to\nCareer & Leadership Development (CLD)\nresources as an alumni!\nIf students are interested in OPT, it is time to apply for OPT and find a job.  Visit the\nCareer & Leadership Development (CLD)\nfor more information on Resume, Cover letter, Interview Skills, Networking, Salary Negotiations, etc.\nIf students will not be applying for OPT and will return to their home country for employment, we highly recommend that they write down the highlights and key challenges that they have experienced during their time in the U.S, and how they overcame them. Students could use these stories to help them stand out among their peers during interviews back home!\nJ-1 Exchange Students\nAcademic Training Extension\nAcademic Training\nMany J-1 exchange students choose to apply to participate in Academic Training after their period of study ends, as doing so allows them to work full-time (only part-time Academic Training is allowed while classes are in session). Students approved for full-time Academic Program will receive a new DS-2019 with extended program end dates. To learn more about Academic Training eligibility, please review the Academic Training section of the Division of International Education's website.\nAbout Academic Training\nIMPORTANT: Students participating in Academic Training after the end of their academic program must begin Academic Training no more than 30 days after the end of their academic program (as indicated on the student’s original Form DS-2019).\nJ-1 Grace Period\nGrace Period\nUpon completion of their program, J-1 visa holders receive a 30-day grace period before they must leave the U.S.  During the grace period, J-1 visa holders may travel within the United States, but they may not leave and re-enter the United States with their expired DS-2019 immigration document. Additionally, working and participating in other academic programs are not permitted during the student’s grace period.\nTranscripts\nAt the end of each semester, the Exchange student advisors send paper copies of exchange students’ official transcripts to their home universities. Generally, transcripts do not become available until several weeks after the end of the semester, after which it may take additional time for the Exchange student advisors to receive and mail them. Therefore, students’ patience is appreciated. J-1 exchange students do\nnot\nneed to request that their SF State transcripts be sent to their home universities, this is done automatically by the Exchange student advisors.\nStudents may learn when transcripts will become available for a specific semester by visiting the\nAcademic Calendar\n. Additionally, students may request transcripts for personal use through the\nRegistrar’s Office\n.\nProgram Extensions\nJ-1 exchange students studying for one (1) semester may extend their program of study to two (2) semesters in special circumstances.  Before any extension can be considered, the student requesting the extension must submit the following to\nexchange@sfsu.edu\nbefore the deadline:\nWritten permission from their home university authorizing the extension;\nProof of sufficient financial resources for the 2nd semester ($15,000 Spring, $15,000 Fall);\nProof of enrollment in the International Student Health Insurance for the 2nd semester.\nDeadlines:\nExtending to Spring from the Fall: November 01\nExtending to Fall from the Spring: April 01\nQuick Links\nCurrent Students\nVisa and Immigration\nMaintaining Status\nU.S. Employment Authorization\nTravel\nNew Students\nImportant Dates\nPre-Arrival Checklist\nOrientation\nOther Resources\nHealth Insurance Requirement and U.S. Health Care\nLife in San Francisco\nWellness & Academic Success\nContact an Advisor\nLast updated:\nDecember 2024\nFor PDF files, Adobe Acrobat 5.0 or above is required to view it.

    "content": "Hosting a Visiting Scholar\nThe Division of International Education (formerly Office of International Programs) supports the international endeavors of SF State faculty members by providing information and support, identifying opportunities, coordinating activities for faculty international development, and working with faculty to help internationalize the curriculum.\nSan Francisco State University Faculty who would like to host a visiting scholar should contact\nexchange@sfsu.edu\nfor more information.\nVisiting Scholar Program\nOverview of the Visiting Scholar Program\nWhat is a J-1 Visiting Scholar?\nA J-1 Scholar is a visiting researcher, professor, or specialist from a country outside of the United States who has been approved to enter the United States for a specific purpose and for a limited amount of time.  The\nJ-1 Exchange Visitor Program\nis administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) for the express purpose of promoting international educational exchange of expertise and stimulating collaborative teaching and research efforts.\nThe purpose of the J-1 visa is to increase mutual understanding between people of the US and people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges, thereby strengthening the ties between the world's nations. Every year SF State sponsors several dozen “Exchange Visitors” for full-time, temporary activities that include teaching, lecturing, observing, conducting research, consulting, or demonstrating special skills.\nThe Division of International Education is responsible for administering the J-1 Visiting Scholar Program at SF State.\nHosting an International Visiting Scholar\nHow to Sponsor a J-1 Exchange Visitor\nWhen to begin\nFaculty members should begin the process as early as possible, allowing sufficient time for the Exchange Visitor to apply for and receive the J-1\nvisa\nand travel to the US. If complete information is submitted to the Division of International Education, the Form DS-2019 Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status will be sent to the sponsoring academic department within two weeks. The department should forward the DS-2019 to the Exchange Visitor at least three months in advance of the program start date.\nHow to Submit a Visiting Scholar J-1 Visa Request to\nthe Division of International Education\nStep 1: The sponsoring academic department gathers supporting documents and information from the prospective Exchange Visitor, acquires approval signatures from the Department Chair and Dean, and submits the J-Visa Request Form to the Division of International Education.\nStep 2: The Division of International Education reviews the request for completeness. The Division of International Education then generates and issues the DS-2019 document by creating a record for the Exchange Visitor in the Student & Exchange Visitor Information System (\"SEVIS\").  SEVIS is the US government's immigration database.  The sponsoring academic department then sends the DS-2019 physically to the Exchange Visitor.\n- Note - it is against federal law to send the DS-2019 electronically, it must be sent to the Exchange Visitor physically.\nStep 3: The Exchange Visitor receives the DS-2019, reviews it for errors, and then schedules a visa appointment (except Canadian citizens) with the US embassy or consulate in their home country at:\nhttp://www.usembassy.gov/\nThe Exchange Visitor then pays the SEVIS fee online at least three days before their visa appointment at\nhttps://www.fmjfee.com\n.\nStep 4: The U.S. Embassy / Consulate reviews the Exchange Visitor's visa application, conducts an interview and background check, and issues a J-1 visa stamp in the Exchange Visitor's passport.\nStep 5: The Exchange Visitor arrives in the US, and their visa and original DS-2019 are checked by border agents at their port of entry.\nStep 6: The Exchange Visitor checks in with the hosting academic department, and within 30 days of their arrival attends a mandatory check-in/orientation with the Division of International Education.\nHost Department's Responsibilities\nHost Department Responsibilities\nAs a host department, faculty have certain responsibilities to ensure that their invited scholar is successful as a\nJ-1 Exchange Visitor\n. Here are some important things to consider:\nDetermine Position and Visa Type\nWhat type of position will the person have at SF State? The type of activity the visitor is involved in while in the U.S. helps the Division of International Education determine the most appropriate visa category.  There are three primary positions that Exchange Visitors can hold at SF State:\nProfessor / Research Scholar\nProgram Duration: Three (3) weeks to five (5) years (continuous time)\nPrimary Activity: Teaching or collaborative research.  Details are available on the State Department's website for\nProfessors\nand for\nResearch Scholars\n.\nThis category is subject to the 12- and 24-month\nBars on Repeat Participation\n.\nShort-Term Scholar\nProgram Duration: One (1) day to six (6) months\nPrimary Activity: Teaching or collaborative research.  Details are available on the\nState Department's website\n.\nThis category is NOT subject to the 12- and 24-month Bars on Repeat Participation, but may still be influenced by it.\nSpecialist\nProgram Duration: Three (3) weeks to one (1) year\nPrimary Activity: This category is used for visitors who bring a unique skill set and often provide seminars or \"master classes.\" Details are available on the\nState Department's website\n.\nThis category is NOT subject to the 12- and 24-month Bars on Repeat Participation, but may still be influenced by it.\nDetermine funding type\nThe J-1 program requires that Exchange Visitors have sufficient finances to support themselves while in the US.  The following funding types are acceptable:\nPayment from SF State (salary, wage payroll, etc).  The amount and duration should be listed in the offer letter.\nHome Government Funding\nU.S. Government Agency Funding\nInternational Organizations or Other Organizations\nPersonal Savings (Bank Statement)\nThe current minimum required by SF State is $2,000 per month for the duration of the program.  If the Exchange Visitor is accompanied by a spouse or children, an additional $600 for a spouse and $400 per child per month is required.\nExample: An Exchange Visitor conducting research as a Research Scholar for six months, with no accompanying dependents and not being paid by SF State would have to demonstrate a minimum of $12,000 in finances.\nJ-2 Dependents\nIf the visitor will be bringing children, will they need to arrange for enrollment in school or childcare facility? The Division of International Education is not responsible for assisting with such arrangements.\nTransportation\nWill the department arrange or pay for the Exchange Visitor's transportation?  Will someone from the sponsoring department greet and pick up the Exchange Visitor from SFO when they arrive?\nWhat if the scholar is not able to arrive on time?\nThe Division of International Education will create a new DS-2019 and a late arrival letter.  The scholar will carry the late arrival letter along with their DS-2019 to facilitate their entry into the U.S., then pick up the new DS-2019 upon arrival.\nHousing\nWill the department assist the scholars in finding housing upon their arrival in San Francisco?  Visiting Professors who are employed by SF State are eligible to live on campus.  Short-term scholars or scholars whose program of research at SF State is 6 months or less can take advantage of the Guest Suite Program at University Park North. The Division of International Education cannot assist visiting scholars with housing.\nFacilities / Services\nAll J-1 Exchange Visitors will be provided an SF State identification number and email address by the Division of International Education.  Any other resources will be the responsibility of the hosting department to provide.  Will students' scholars need office space?  Access to labs?  A computer?  Faculty should consider these possibilities before their scholar arrives in the U.S.\nFaculty Sponsor & Host Department Responsibilities\nBy extending an invitation to a visiting scholar, the faculty member agrees to the following:\nNotify the scholar of the\nEnglish proficiency requirement.\nNotify the scholar of the\nmedical insurance requirement\n.\nBe present on campus for at least 75% of the scholar's visit (i.e., not on sabbatical or leave).\nEnsure the scholar checks in with the host department immediately upon arrival.\nMeet with the scholar at the start of the program to discuss research strategy and goals.\nBe an\nad hoc\nadviser if the scholar is currently a degree-seeking candidate in their home country.\nHave a general idea of the scholar's whereabouts (e.g., out for illness, out for vacation).\nReport as soon as possible any unexplained, extended absences to the Division of International Education.\nObtain prior approval from the Division of International Education before any changes occur in the scholar's program (e.g., finances, end date, duties).\nContact the Division of International Education and the department's Human Resources representative if the scholar is not performing at previously agreed-upon expectations.\nTo comply with the federal regulatory requirements of the exchange visitor program, all sponsoring units must have plans in place to offer cross-cultural opportunities to J-1 exchange visitors and their J-2 dependents.\nExtensions:\nIf a hosting department wants to extend the dates of a scholar's program\nafter\nthe program has begun, the\nrequest must be made in writing no later than 60 days before the scholar's current program end date.  Extensions cannot be completed after a scholar's program ends, so timeliness is very important if you wish to extend a scholar's program.\nHost departments must submit a new Request Form signed by host, chair and dean. Check\nthe 'Extension J-1' box on page 1, and submit new financial support documents; a formal letter approving\nthe extension, and proof that the scholar has extended their health insurance to the new program end date\nin the extension letter.\nVisiting Scholar's Responsibilities\nCheck-in Upon Arrival\nJ-1 Exchange Visitors who are new to SF State (including those transferring from another institution in the U.S.) must receive an orientation and be validated in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) no later than 30 days after the program start date indicated in Part 3 of the DS-2019 form. Exchange visitors must go through this orientation so that their arrival on campus can be reported to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as required by federal law.  The Division of International Education facilitates this orientation.\nUpdated Check-In Procedures\nThe Division of International Education has discontinued in-person check-in sessions due to ongoing campus closures related to COVID-19. All check-in requirements can be met by remote orientation and validation.\nExchange visitors should email\nexchange@sfsu.edu\nto request a remote check-in and validation as soon as possible after arrival in the United States. Exchange visitors will be required to review orientation information and complete a form confirming their arrival and providing all U.S. contact information.  Once the form is completed and signed, the exchange visitor will return it to the Division of International Education along with the following documents:\nI-94 record\n(either the paper I-94 card in their passport OR a printout of their electronic I-94 record)\nDS-2019 form\nThe j visa stamp on the passport\nProof of health insurance coverage\nUpon receipt of all documents, the Division of International Education will validate the exchange visitor’s record in SEVIS. Failure to be validated in SEVIS within 30 days of the start date on the DS-2019 causes automatic revocation of the exchange visitor’s lawful J-1 status and may lead to detention and deportation if not remedied immediately.\nMaintenance of Required Health Insurance Coverage\nJ-1 Visiting Scholars are required by both SF State and the U.S. Government to maintain appropriate health insurance coverage for the entirety of their program.  SF State partners with United HealthCare to provide a comprehensive health insurance plan for J-1 Visiting Scholars and their dependents, and this is the only insurance plan that SF State can accept.  To purchase the insurance, please follow the link below:\nVisit United HealthCare’s student portal at\nhttp://www.uhcsr.com/sfsu\nand when prompted select the 'Visiting Scholar' plan.  The plan allows scholars to purchase the insurance monthly for up to 12 months, depending on the length of their program.\nUnderstanding the J-1 Visa and DS-2019\nUnderstanding the DS-2019\nThe DS-2019 is a paper document issued by the Division of International Education certifying that a visiting scholar's admission into the program at SF State has been accepted and approved. The DS-2019 is officially titled the \"Certificate of Eligibility\" because, with it, Exchange Visitors are \"eligible\" to apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. Their spouse or children will also each need their own DS-2019 to obtain J-2 dependent status.\nGetting the DS-2019 from SF State is not enough to become a legal J-1 visitor; one must also apply for and successfully be issued a J-1 visa.\nBefore entering the United States\nThe DS-2019 is created when the Division of International Education enters a scholar's biographical information into a U.S. government database called SEVIS (\nS\ntudent and\nE\nxchange\nV\nisitor\nI\nnformation\nS\nystem).  The sponsoring academic department sends the DS-2019 in the mail to the scholar in their home country.  Scholars will need the DS-2019 to make a visa appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad.  If there are any errors on the DS-2019, it is the scholar's responsibility to contact the Division of International Education immediately\nto correct them.\nAfter their visa interview is successful, a J-1 visa stamp will be placed on their passport.  The J-1 visa is the document needed to be allowed entry into the United States.\nDo not throw the DS-2019 away\n, it is very important that students keep both it and their J-1 visa stamp safe. The DS-2019 must be presented along with the J-1 visa to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry.\nAfter entering the United States\nOnce Exchange Visitors arrive in the United States and pass through the border inspection process, the DS-2019 will be used for identification purposes and proof of legal J-1 status. If they travel abroad and then return to the United States during the course of their J-1 program, they must take their DS-2019 with them, as it will be required by border agents when they re-enter the United States.\nIf they plan to travel outside the United States during their J-1 program, make sure that they have a valid 'travel signature' from the Division of International Education on the lower-right corner of the DS-2019. This signature is valid for one year for multiple visits outside the United States or until the DS-2019 expires, whichever comes first. To obtain a travel signature, they must submit their original DS-2019 to the Division of International Education; please allow a minimum of 48 hours for their DS-2019 to be signed.  Note: Exchange Visitors should be sure to plan and get this done several weeks before they depart the United States to avoid the busy time before the major holiday travel season!\nUnderstanding the 212(E) Two-Year Home Residency Requirement\nWhat is the 212(e) Two-Year Home Residency Requirement, and am I subject to it?\nSome countries require J-1 visa holders to return to and reside in their home country for a minimum of two years after the end of their J-1 program in the U.S.  If Exchange Visitors have a J-1 Visa and meet one or more of the criteria listed below, they may be subject.  If they are subject, it will be marked on their J-1 Visa stamp and/or DS-2019. If they are subject to the requirement, any J-2 dependents are also subject to this requirement.\nCriteria\nExchange Visitors have received funding from their government or the U.S. government for J-1 program participation; or,\nTheir\nskills\nare deemed to be in short supply by their home country; or,\nExchange Visitors have participated in clinical training (i.e. a medical residency or fellowship)\nIf Exchange Visitors are subject to the two-year home residency requirement, they must “reside and be physically present” in their home country for an aggregate period of two years after completion of their J-1 program OR apply for a waiver of this requirement before being eligible for certain immigration benefits. If they are subject to 212(e), they are also ineligible for the following benefits:\nAn immigrant visa or adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident (immigrant/green card) status.\nH Visa (temporary workers and dependents), an L Visa (intra-company transferees and dependents), or a K Visa (fiancé and dependents).\nA change of their non-immigrant status within the U.S. from J to any other non-immigrant category except A (diplomatic), G (international organization), or U (victims of qualifying criminal activity) statuses.\nWaiver of 212(e)\nPlease note that if they intend to apply for a waiver of the 212(e), Exchange Visitors should discuss their plans with the Division of International Education and their host department, as this can impact their eligibility for an extension of their J-1 status or a transfer of their J-1 record to a new institution.  Applying for a waiver and having it approved without consulting the Division of International Education and their host department does not obligate SF State to sponsor them for an H-1B.\nUseful Resources\nDocuments & Resources\nDOWNLOAD THE VISITING SCHOLAR REQUEST FORM HERE\nU.S. State Department - Exchange Visitors Visa",
