    "question": "What is the topic of the graduate seminar on November 02, 2023, and what are the main areas of focus?",
    "answer": "The graduate seminar on November 02, 2023, focuses on AI-driven advancements in two main areas: battery materials and Alzheimer's biomarker detection. In battery research, AI techniques are employed to enhance the safety and performance of Lithium Metal Batteries (LMBs) using a deep learning model called batteryNet. In computational pathology, novel AI methodologies are used to detect Alzheimer's biomarkers by merging molecular signals from PET imaging with neural microstructures, enabling non-invasive quantification of tau inclusions in live patients.",

    "answer": "The AI-driven approach in computational pathology contributes to the detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers by merging molecular signals from PET imaging with neural microstructures. This enables the non-invasive quantification of tau inclusions in live patients, which can potentially expedite PET tracer clinical approvals for neurodegenerative diseases. The study also synergizes postmortem studies with live patient imaging, allowing for unprecedented detection of Alzheimer's biomarkers.",

    "question": "What is CODIS and why should I, as a student, care about it?",
    "answer": "CODIS, or the Combined DNA Index System, is a system of criminal justice DNA databases used by law enforcement to identify individuals. It uses specific genetic markers (STRs) to match samples found at crime scenes to profiles stored in the database, which include samples from convicted offenders, felony arrestees, missing persons, and even crime victims. As a student, you should care because a recent SF State study suggests that these forensic profiles may indirectly reveal medical information about individuals, including crime victims, which challenges the assumption that CODIS markers don't relay medical information. This raises ethical and legal questions about medical privacy within these databases and who has access to them. Furthermore, the study highlights how the assumption that only criminals are sampled is inaccurate, as victims of crime and people present at crime scenes are also included.",

They used publicly available data from the 1000 Genomes Project and genetic models to analyze the 20 CODIS markers and determine if there was a correlation between these markers and gene expression.

However, it's important to note that represented employees were not subject to the booster requirement until the CSU concluded its meet-and-confer process with its labor unions. You were considered in compliance if you received the initial vaccine series but were not yet eligible for a booster until you became eligible.

    "question": "Why is AI's growing power demand a problem for decarbonizing the power grid?",
    "answer": "AI and cloud computing are rapidly increasing electric power consumption in the US. Projections estimate increases of 2% by 2026 and 6% by 2030. This growth strains the power grid's stability and slows down decarbonization efforts. Datacenter loads, already consuming a significant portion of power (15-25% in some grids), contribute to the problem by hindering the retirement of fossil fuel generation and even prompting the addition of new fossil fuel sources. Essentially, the climate change impact of computing is poised to increase significantly.",

  {
    "question": "How can data centers and power grids cooperate to promote decarbonization, and what's wrong with the current approach?",
    "answer": "Currently, data centers treat power as an 'on-demand' service, which is challenging for renewable-based grids to support. A new framework is needed that fosters cooperation between data center loads and power grids through continuous matching. This approach addresses the fundamental conflict between loads and renewable power grids, supporting both efficient computing and power grid decarbonization. Current carbon accounting and cloud practices, like long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), often transfer carbon emissions responsibility to other grid customers, which is not a fair or sustainable solution. The goal is to move beyond these transactional frameworks to more equitable metric framings for carbon emissions.",
