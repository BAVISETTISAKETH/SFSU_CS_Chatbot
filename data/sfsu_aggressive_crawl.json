    "content": "Sequence of Study\nThe curriculums of both CS master’s degree programs are carefully designed to span over four terms. We recommend that our graduate students follow the term-by-term roadmap described below.  Students are also encouraged to meet with a Graduate Advisor at least once every  term for advice and guidance.\nFirst and foremost, you want to gain a clear understanding of your respective program’s degree requirements:\nM.Sc. in Computer Science\n,\nM.Sc. in Data Science & AI\n. Keep in mind the following requirements to maintain your graduate student status:\nGraduate students are required to maintain a 3.0 grade point average (B or above) each and every semester.\nFor a given course, the minimum allowable grade is B- if you plan to use this course to satisfy one of the degree requirements.\nInternational students are required to enroll in a minimum of 8 units per semester. You will be eligible to take fewer than 8 units after you are enrolled in CSC 897 or CSC 899, a course directly related to your Master’s thesis project.  See\nhere\nfor more details on this requirement.\nSecond, you are required to complete a total of 30 units (or 10 3-unit graduate-level courses). You are recommended to distribute these 30 units as follows:\nTerm 1:   9 units (3 courses)\nTerm 2: 12 units (4 courses)\nTerm 3:   6 units (2 courses: 1 lecture-based course; CSC 897 or CSC 899 supervised by your Master’s thesis/project mentor)\nTerm 4:   3 units (1 course: CSC 895 or CSC 898, supervised by your Master’s thesis/project mentor)\nFinally, if you are a current graduate student in Computer Science, log into\nthis internal website\nfor more specifics.\nFirst Semester\nEnroll in 9 units (or 3 3-unit courses) in your first semester.\nFor students admitted with conditional undergraduate courses (which are listed on your official admission letter), you are required to complete these courses with a letter grade of B or above by the due date stated on your admission letter.\nFor the\nEnglish Level I\nrequirement, the preferred course is SCI 614. If SCI 614 is not offered, you can enroll in ENG 670 instead.\nFor those with fewer conditional courses, it is okay to enroll in graduate-level courses together with your conditional course(s) in your first term.\nStart attending the\nCS Graduate Seminars\nduring your first semester. Each Semester, approximately eight seminars will be offered.\nYou are required to attend the first graduate seminar that overviews the two graduate programs.\nYou are required to complete a total of 10 seminars by the end of the  term prior to enrolling in the Master’s thesis/project course, i.e., CSC 895 or CSC 898.\nStart thinking about your areas of interest, looking into the CS faculty team’s\nresearch areas\n, and identifying a few Master’s thesis project ideas. You are highly recommended to meet and discuss your project ideas with relevant faculty members.\nNote that only the faculty members listed under the\nFaculty\ncategory and the department chairpersons are eligible to chair a student’s Master’s thesis project committee. We commonly refer to them as faculty mentors, in contrast with regular graduate advisors.\nIt is\ncritical\nto plan to take graduate-level electives with possible culminating experience with faculty mentors during your first year of study\nSecond Semester\nIf you have not done so, it is time to make a term-by-term course-taking plan for your graduate studies by referring to the degree requirements (\nM.Sc. in Computer Science\n,\nM.Sc. in Data Science & AI\n). Use the\nAdvanced Class Search\ninterface to get a rough idea on the courses that had been routinely offered in the past Spring or Fall semesters. Many graduate-level courses are typically offered in either the Spring or Fall semester.\nShare your course plan with your graduate advisor to proactively seek their feedback.\nHave identified at least a couple of Master’s thesis/project ideas and the corresponding faculty mentors.\nEnroll in at least three courses.At least one of the courses should be taught by your prospective thesis/project mentor. Communicate your intent with your prospective  mentors in advance and start to foster a professional mentor-mentee relationship.\nBy the end of this term, you are expected to have selected your culminating experience (a.k.a. Master’s thesis/project) mentor and obtain this mentor’s permission to work under their supervision.\nSemester Break\nInvestigate culminating experience topics and work with your mentor on obtaining background knowledge/skills.\nPossibly do an external internship to get practical experience in CSC 893. This typically happens during the summer break.  Note that you are not required to enroll in CSC 893, but it is nice to include it in your transcript.  Check the\n“Fall/Spring CPT”\nsection for the CSC 893 enrollment process.\nThird Semester\nAdjust your course planner made during the second term. You are highly recommended to meet with your graduate advisor for advice and guidance\nWork with your master’s thesis/project mentor to enroll in CSC 897/899 for background work on Thesis/Project.  Enroll in other courses as needed to meet other degree requirements.\nIf you are an international student and enrolled in less than 8 units this semester, contact your master’s thesis/project mentor to prepare and submit to the SFSU Office of International Programs (OIP) a letter of support on your behalf.\nComplete and submit the Advancement To Candidacy (ATC) form prior to university deadlines (November 1 or April 1). All courses included in the ATC form must be at or above B-.\nComplete and submit the Proposal for Culminating Experience (PCE) form prior to university deadlines (November 1 or April 1).  Note that if Human or Animal Subjects Protocols are required, these must also be approved by your mentor and submitted by this deadline.\nSubmit the long project/thesis proposal to the CS department.\nFor current graduate students,\nclick\nhere\nto read about the specific criteria and procedures to enroll in CSC 897/899, CSC 895/898. It also includes procedures on preparing and submitting the ATC and PCE forms, and the long proposal.\nFourth (and final) Semester\nEnroll in your mentor’s CSC 895/898 for your Master’s project/thesis.\nComplete your Master’s project/thesis project by closely working with your mentor and your other committee member(s).\nReady to graduate?  Click\nhere\nto view more details about the following steps.\nApply for graduation.\nWork on your written thesis/report.\nSchedule thesis/project Oral Defense.\nDefend your Master’s thesis/project.\nFinalize all thesis/project materials and submit them to the Computer Science department and/or SFSU.\nThe “Grace” Semester\nThe Spring or Fall semester following the semester of your CSC 895/898 enrollment is often referred to as the “grace” semester. Every graduate student is granted this grace semester to complete their CSC 895/898 project. Students are not required to enroll in any courses during their grace semester.\nBeyond the “Grace” Semester\nStudents who do not complete their CSC 895/898 after the grace semester must enroll in a 0-unit\nCulminating Experience Continuous Enrollment\ncourse (i.e.,\nSCI 499\n) with the College of Professional & Global Education (CPaGL) and every subsequent semester until CSC 895/898 is completed.\nEnrollment in SCI 499 provides you access to SFSU libraries, discipline-associated laboratories and facilities, and Culminating Experience advisors.\nStudents are automatically withdrawn from their degree program if they fail to maintain continuous enrollment status after the grace semester.\nStudents who do not maintain continuous enrollment in their Culminating Experience course and subsequently return to complete their Culminating Experience within the 7-year time limit to complete requirements for graduate degrees must be reinstated in their degree program and may have to file a new Proposal for Culminating Experience.\nStudents who are past the 7-year limit must formally reapply for admission to the program in which they were completing their Culminating Experience. There is no guarantee of readmission.",

    "content": "Student Policies\nThe university is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy living and learning environment for students, faculty, and staff. Each campus community member should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end. Therefore, students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, be civil to one another and others in the campus community, and contribute positively to student and university life.\nPrerequisite Policy\nCS Department strictly enforces prerequisites for all courses.\nPrerequisites are checked by CS faculty at the beginning of each course.\nA grade of\nC or better is required\nto be accepted as a prerequisite.\nThe final decision about whether a student is ready to take a course is made by the instructor who teaches the course.\nCheating and Plagiarism Policy\nBy academic cheating and plagiarism we mean presenting, as your own work, material produced by or in collaboration with others, or permitting or assisting others to present your work as their own without proper acknowledgment.\nThe policies of San Francisco State University, with respect to cheating and plagiarism, are stated in SF State's Bulletin. Courses involving computer programming require special consideration because use of the computer permits easy copying and trivial modification of programs. In addition, our polices also address availability of content and services on the Internet which can be used for plagiarism and cheating. The following guidelines are provided to help in determining if an incident of cheating or plagiarism has occurred.\nThe instructor may suspect a student of program plagiarism if the student submits a program that is so similar to the program submitted by a present or past student in the course that the solutions may be converted to one another by a simple mechanical transformation.\nThe instructor may suspect a student of cheating, whether on a program or an examination, if the student cannot explain both the intricacies of his or her solution and the techniques and principles used to generate that solution.\nIt should be clear that there is latitude for difference among individual instructors, particularly on the matter of when working with other students or adapting material from a textbook is permissible. The following general policy on cooperation on homework assignments holds:\nIn all circumstances it is acceptable to discuss the meaning of assignments and general approaches and strategies for handling those assignments with other members of the Academic Community. Any cooperation beyond that point, including shared pseudocode or flowcharts, shared code, or shared documentation, is only acceptable if specifically so permitted by the class instructor in written guidelines distributed to the entire class.\nThe Penalty\nIn cases of academic cheating or plagiarism, no credit will be given for the assignment in question and a record will be kept in the Computer Science department office. If a second or further incident is reported for an individual, or if the circumstances of a first incident so warrant, a letter describing the incident(s) will be forwarded to the Student Discipline Officer for possible disciplinary action, which may include expulsion, suspension, or probation; as well as lesser sanctions. Please refer to the Supplemental Regulations and Procedures section of SF State's Bulletin for details.\nAny student using Rentacoder or similar WWW service in any relation to schoolwork will be dealt with most seriously, including possible expulsion from the university.\nExamples\nWhen a student turns in the work of another student and represents it as his or her own work.\nWhen a student knowingly permits another to turn in his or her work.\nWhen a student copies code from the work of another student.\nWhen a student deliberately transforms borrowed sections of code in order to disguise their origin.\nWhen several students collaborate on a project and fail to inform the instructor of this.\nWhen a student steals or obtains examinations, answer keys, or program samples from the instructors files or computer directories.\nWhen a student modifies or deletes another student's or an instructor's computer files.\nWhen a student uses content from other sources like Internet and includes it in his/her work or projects without proper attribution.\nWhen a student uses Internet or other services to post assignments and seek solutions.\nWhen Internet resources are used verbatim and/or \"cut and pasted\" into students work regardless whether they are acknowledged or not.\nWhen Does It Not Occur?\nWhen students have permission to collaborate on a project, and list all collaborators.\nWhen students receive advice from instructors, teaching assistants, or staff members involved in the course.\nWhen students share knowledge about syntax errors, coding tricks, or other language-specific information that makes programming easier.\nWhen students engage in a general discussion of the nature of an assignment, the requirements for an assignment, or general implementation strategies.\nWhen students compare independent solutions to an assignment in order to better understand the nature of the assignment.\nWhen students engage in discussion of course concepts or programming strategies in preparation for an assignment or examination.\nWhen students copy code and cite its source on assignments for which the instructor allows inclusion of code other than the student's own.\nHow to Check for Plagiarism\nPlease consult with your course instructor if you have any questions regarding whether or not your work with other students and/or materials prepared for submission are appropriate. The following examples illustrate situations when Academic Cheating and/or Plagiarism has and has not occurred.

    "content": "Apply\nRequest Info\nGraduate Certificates\nWe welcome applications from current enrolled SF State graduate students (domestic and international) and non-enrolled post-baccalaureate domestic students interested in Software Engineering and Ethical Artificial Intelligence Graduate Certificates.\nApplications are due by\nFebruary 1, 2025 for Fall\nadmission unless the academic department requires an earlier deadline.\nTwo Graduate Certificates Options\nEthical Artificial Intelligence\nStudents in the Certificate Program will be guided and advised by the Supervisory Committee comprising faculty from SF State’s programs in Computer Science, Business and Philosophy, and these programs’ graduate advisors.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming an integral technology in many areas (medicine, health, autonomous driving cars, business, loan approvals, law enforcement, distribution of government and health services, news filtering, etc.) and is often considered the driving force of a 4th technological revolution.\nAcademic Bulletin: AI\nRead more Ethical AI\nThe impact of AI is expanding rapidly, but due to its complexity it offers challenges to ensuring proper, ethical, unbiased and transparent operations. This is evidenced by increasing reporting on the use and misuse of AI in government and media, and calls for greater scrutiny and oversight. Skills related to ethical use of AI will be more and more important for both developers and users of AI technology.\nTo address these needs, SF State’s Computer Science Department, College of Business and Philosophy Department established a multi-College Graduate Certificate in Ethical AI. Our approach to this certificate is unique in its multidisciplinary and multi-College nature, which involves three critical areas necessary to understanding this subject, as outlined below. Students must take one course from each of these three areas (total of 9 units) and also complete a self reflection research paper (1 unit):\nAI Technologies and Applications\n: courses in this core area focus on algorithmic and technical principles of AI and can be selected to fit the background of graduate students from Computer Science, Business or Philosophy.\nEthics and Compliance in Business\n: focus on integrity, understanding and applying managerial ethical decision-making; understanding regulatory compliance as it relates to organizational functions; developing ethics training, and evaluating stakeholder impacts.\nEthics Principles\n: courses on the ethical, political, and social ramifications of current and emerging uses of AI.\nSelf-reflection Research Paper\n: the certificate program requires a culminating research paper to demonstrate student self-reflection on specific issues in AI ethics. Students take a 1-unit independent study in conjunction with this course, to be supervised by one of the faculty advisors (see below for a list of advisors).\nSince the Certificate has multiple overlapping courses with current MS, MBA and MA programs in Computer Science, Management, and Philosophy, our matriculated graduate students can easily complete the Certificate with minimal overhead. This certificate is also designed to fit the needs of professionals from industry who can use it to continue their education and gain an additional credential that will be appealing to employers who are concerned about being good stewards of AI and responsibly managing their business practices as more regulation and public scrutiny of AI comes to pass.\nAI Contacts\nPlease contact one of the following faculty in the AI Certificate Supervisory Committee:\nProfessor Denise Kleinrichert\n, College of Business, SF State. Expertise in business ethics, corporate social responsibility, risk management, and environmental sustainability has been at SF State since 2007.\nProfessor Carlos Montemayor\n,\nPhilosophy Department, SF State. Expertise in philosophy of mind, cognitive science, philosophy of psychology and epistemology has been at SF State since 2009.\nProfessor Dragutin Petkovic\n, CS Department, SF State, IEEE Life fellow. Expertise in AI, Usability and SW Engineering. Twenty years of industry experience has been at SF State since 2003.\nAll are available to respond to inquiries, but it is best to contact the faculty whose field of research most closely aligns with your background and interests.\nSoftware Engineering\nWe are witnessing ever increasing demand for CS graduates in multiple industries worldwide. Successful professionals in computing-related industries must attain and continuously update skills in Software Engineering (SE) in order to have successful careers.\nThe Graduate Certificate in SE is an opportunity to meet the critical needs of matriculated as well as non-matriculated students in attaining and updating highly sought-after skills for their success in their careers as software (SW) engineers.\nAcademic Bulletin: Software Engineering\nRead more Software Engineering\nSince the Certificate has multiple overlapping courses with SF State’s current MS in CS program, students in the program can easily complete the Certificate with minimal overhead, and gain an additional credential to showcase their Software Engineering skills.\nProfessionals from industry can efficiently continue their software education and gain additional credentials by completing the Certificate.\nHere are the basis for the three core areas of our Graduate Certificate in SW Engineering:\nStudents will be able to complete the SE Certificate in 2 to 3 semesters. Courses in each group in the certificate are offered regularly by the CS Department.\nStudents in the certificate program will be guided/advised by the Supervisory Committee, and the Computer Science Department’s graduate advisors.\nBoth matriculated and non-matriculated students can apply for this certificate provided they have adequate qualifications as described in application process.\nOn completion of this certificate, students will attain skills in three categories:\nBasic SW systems and technologies (large SW development, cloud computing, WWW engineering, mobile technologies, distributed and large scale systems etc.)\nSE modern processes covering the full SE lifecycle (Agile, SCRUM, User Centered Design, SE teamwork and organization etc.)\nExposure to modern SE applications and technologies\nThe three core areas covered in this certificate are:\nCore requirements\nfocusing on SE best practices, teamwork and organization (two courses, 6 units)\nCore options\nfocusing on important SE applications and technologies (one course, 3 units)\nElectives\nincluding a number of SE related courses (one course, 3 units)\nSoftware Engineering Contacts\nPlease contact one of the following faculty in the Software Engineering Supervisory Committee:\nProfessor Dragutin Petkovic\nhas industry and startup experience in media content management, SW Engineering and usability.

Virtual Reality (VR) enhances these cognitive processes, transforming vocational training through dynamic, interactive environments. My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), artificial intelligence (AI), and immersive technologies, focusing on adaptive learning systems that optimize work performance and memory retention.\nIn this talk, I will present two key projects: OGMA, a VR-based language learning system that significantly improved memory retention, and VISTAS (Vocational Immersive Storytelling Training and Support Framework), which integrates Augmented Reality (AR) and reinforcement learning to personalize skill training. A core aspect of my approach is Storyfication, a narrative-driven framework that gamifies skill acquisition. Additionally, I will share insights from industry collaborations, including my role at Edstutia, a VR startup revolutionizing professional training.\nThis event also marks the launch of RED Lab – Reality Experience Design Lab, where we will explore VR’s impact on human consciousness, learning, and performance. Our research will investigate how immersive experiences enhance engagement, memory, and skill acquisition, collaborating across psychology, kinesiology, theatre, cinema, arts, communication, and business to push the boundaries of interdisciplinary research.\nJoin me as we discuss the evolution of VR/AR technology, its real-world applications, design challenges, and future opportunities—bridging the gap between human cognition and immersive storytelling to shape the future of work and education.\nSpeaker Biography\nHey there!

We introduce Iterative Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP), a parameterized approximate message-passing scheme. Built upon the principles of bounded inference, notably the mini-clustering algorithm, and Pearl’s belief propagation algorithm (BP), IJGP emerges as a novel approach within the framework of Generalized Belief Propagation algorithms. This framework establishes connections with approximate algorithms from statistical physics, and also facilitates connections to iterative decoding algorithms in information theory. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IJGP surpasses both mini-clustering and belief propagation, along with several other state-of-the-art algorithms, across various classes of networks. Additionally, we provide insights into the accuracy of iterative BP and IJGP by drawing connections to well-known classes of constraint propagation schemes.\nSpeaker Biography\nRobert Mateescu is a Senior Principal Researcher at Western Digital and an Adjunct Faculty in Computer Science at San Francisco State University, currently teaching Deep Learning.

Each campus community member should choose behaviors that contribute toward this end. Therefore, students are expected to be good citizens and to engage in responsible behaviors that reflect well upon their university, be civil to one another and others in the campus community, and contribute positively to student and university life.\nPrerequisite Policy\nCS Department strictly enforces prerequisites for all courses.\nPrerequisites are checked by CS faculty at the beginning of each course.\nA grade of\nC or better is required\nto be accepted as a prerequisite.\nThe final decision about whether a student is ready to take a course is made by the instructor who teaches the course.\nCheating and Plagiarism Policy\nBy academic cheating and plagiarism we mean presenting, as your own work, material produced by or in collaboration with others, or permitting or assisting others to present your work as their own without proper acknowledgment.\nThe policies of San Francisco State University, with respect to cheating and plagiarism, are stated in SF State's Bulletin. Courses involving computer programming require special consideration because use of the computer permits easy copying and trivial modification of programs. In addition, our polices also address availability of content and services on the Internet which can be used for plagiarism and cheating. The following guidelines are provided to help in determining if an incident of cheating or plagiarism has occurred.\nThe instructor may suspect a student of program plagiarism if the student submits a program that is so similar to the program submitted by a present or past student in the course that the solutions may be converted to one another by a simple mechanical transformation.\nThe instructor may suspect a student of cheating, whether on a program or an examination, if the student cannot explain both the intricacies of his or her solution and the techniques and principles used to generate that solution.\nIt should be clear that there is latitude for difference among individual instructors, particularly on the matter of when working with other students or adapting material from a textbook is permissible. The following general policy on cooperation on homework assignments holds:\nIn all circumstances it is acceptable to discuss the meaning of assignments and general approaches and strategies for handling those assignments with other members of the Academic Community. Any cooperation beyond that point, including shared pseudocode or flowcharts, shared code, or shared documentation, is only acceptable if specifically so permitted by the class instructor in written guidelines distributed to the entire class.\nThe Penalty\nIn cases of academic cheating or plagiarism, no credit will be given for the assignment in question and a record will be kept in the Computer Science department office. If a second or further incident is reported for an individual, or if the circumstances of a first incident so warrant, a letter describing the incident(s) will be forwarded to the Student Discipline Officer for possible disciplinary action, which may include expulsion, suspension, or probation; as well as lesser sanctions. Please refer to the Supplemental Regulations and Procedures section of SF State's Bulletin for details.\nAny student using Rentacoder or similar WWW service in any relation to schoolwork will be dealt with most seriously, including possible expulsion from the university.\nExamples\nWhen a student turns in the work of another student and represents it as his or her own work.\nWhen a student knowingly permits another to turn in his or her work.\nWhen a student copies code from the work of another student.\nWhen a student deliberately transforms borrowed sections of code in order to disguise their origin.\nWhen several students collaborate on a project and fail to inform the instructor of this.\nWhen a student steals or obtains examinations, answer keys, or program samples from the instructors files or computer directories.\nWhen a student modifies or deletes another student's or an instructor's computer files.\nWhen a student uses content from other sources like Internet and includes it in his/her work or projects without proper attribution.\nWhen a student uses Internet or other services to post assignments and seek solutions.\nWhen Internet resources are used verbatim and/or \"cut and pasted\" into students work regardless whether they are acknowledged or not.\nWhen Does It Not Occur?\nWhen students have permission to collaborate on a project, and list all collaborators.\nWhen students receive advice from instructors, teaching assistants, or staff members involved in the course.\nWhen students share knowledge about syntax errors, coding tricks, or other language-specific information that makes programming easier.\nWhen students engage in a general discussion of the nature of an assignment, the requirements for an assignment, or general implementation strategies.\nWhen students compare independent solutions to an assignment in order to better understand the nature of the assignment.\nWhen students engage in discussion of course concepts or programming strategies in preparation for an assignment or examination.\nWhen students copy code and cite its source on assignments for which the instructor allows inclusion of code other than the student's own.\nHow to Check for Plagiarism\nPlease consult with your course instructor if you have any questions regarding whether or not your work with other students and/or materials prepared for submission are appropriate.

    "content": "SF State Science Coding Programs Boost Biotech Diversity\nAuthor:\nKate High\nDecember 16, 2020\nPhoto Credit:\nSF State News (Strategic Marketing and Communications)\nGrants impact SF State’s computer science diversity efforts with new certification programs and scholarships\nDespite the San Francisco Bay Area being one of the most diverse regions in the country, the technology industries that call it home still lack diversity. Faculty members in the\nPromoting Inclusivity and Computing (PINC)\nprogram at San Francisco State University aim to change this. Their efforts have recently received recognition from both academia and the biotech industry, including two recent grants from the Genentech Foundation and Genentech, Inc. totaling over $1.2 million.\nAssociate Professor of Computer Science Anagha Kulkarni, one of the leaders of PINC, says faculty members and their collaborators at Genentech share a motivation to make tech more diverse. “It’s really highly skewed right now,” she explained. “It’s very male driven — gender diversity is very low, and ethnic and racial diversity are also very low.”\nPINC provides opportunities for non-Computer Science majors to learn coding skills in a supportive environment. In the program’s three years of existence, more than three-quarters of the program’s graduates have been women, and more than half of the students have come from underrepresented minority groups.\nOne of the two grants, for $621,000 provided by Genentech, Inc., will support the development of a new Data Science and Artificial Intelligence certificate program for undergraduates. Researchers at Genentech are also developing curricula alongside San Francisco State faculty members to ensure that students are prepared for success in the biotech industry.\n“As we met over the course of a semester, we all agreed that we need to create a curriculum that is not just designed by us academics but also informed by what practitioners want in the industry,” Kulkarni said. SF State faculty will bring their own expertise in training students, providing undergraduates with graduate-level skillsets, professional development and mentorship.\nThe second grant, $580,750 provided by The Genentech Foundation, will fund scholarships for 10 undergraduates in the PINC minor program each year. One barrier many students face is the need to financially support themselves throughout their undergraduate career, which makes it difficult to take advantage of research opportunities. The funding will allow students in the minor, who are learning a new and complex skillset in order to enter a highly competitive field, the opportunity to focus on their coursework and research without having to take on other jobs. At the same time, they’ll gain access to a network of researchers and mentors from other universities and companies around the Bay Area.\nTech diversity efforts at SF State haven’t just caught the notice of local industry — they’ve turned heads in academia, too. A team of faculty members recently\npublished an article in the journal PLOS Computational Biology\ndescribing an innovative summer program that teaches students to apply coding to their science disciplines.\n“It’s unique in the sense that students are given an opportunity not only to learn coding skills but also in the context of their discipline with a real research project,” said Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Nicole Adelstein, a faculty organizer and advisor for the PINC summer program. Students in this nine-week program learn coding skills while applying them towards topics of their interest and supporting one another in cohorts throughout the summer.\nAnd at the helm of that program are faculty members who are committed to making the computer science and biotech fields more diverse — and whose backgrounds are similar to the students they teach. “Many of the SF State faculty involved in organizing the program, I think, are mostly self-taught programmers,” Adelstein explained. “We’re very motivated to give these students opportunities to explore coding within their own field, in part because we all wish we had started earlier.”\nTags\nGrant\nRelated News\nSFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nSeptember 25, 2025\nCIDER Lab Wins First Prize at Kumo AI Hackathon\nSeptember 11, 2025\nAnnouncement of Two New Grants Awarded From NSF\nAugust 28, 2025\nProfessor Jozo Dujmovic authors new AI book from Springer Nature\nAugust 26, 2025",

Your brain parses incoming sensory information, discovers meaningful patterns between inputs, and directs purposeful action using its 3-pound, 12-Watt hardware. In this talk, I will cover some introductory topics in the field of cognitive computational neuroscience, in which computational methods intersect with cognitive science, neuroscience, and experimental psychology techniques. Using examples from my own and other labs' work, we will explore a range of methods, including computer vision to analyze movement and multivariate pattern analysis techniques to \"decode\" and interpret brain activity data. Beyond pattern classification, we'll also discuss how artificial neural network models are advancing mechanistic accounts of brain processing and addressing deeper \"why\" questions of neural structure and function.\nSpeaker Biography\nSantani Teng is PI of the Cognition, Action, and Neural Dynamics Laboratory at Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San Francisco. Santani received his B.A. in psychology from UC Davis and his Ph.D. in psychology from UC Berkeley, studying the perceptual abilities of blind echolocation practitioners. He conducted postdoctoral work on neural mechanisms of auditory and tactile processing at MIT's Computational Perception and Cognition Laboratory before pursuing a fellowship at SKERI. Established in February 2020, Santani's lab investigates auditory and visual perception, neuroplasticity, haptics, echolocation, and assisted mobility, especially when vision is unavailable. A combination of psychophysical, neurophysiological, engineering, and computational tools are brought to bear on these topics to understand and improve human perception and mobility. Current projects focus on haptic sensing and processing in blind braille readers, as well as the use of reverberation and active echolocation to aid perception and mobility.\nUpcoming Events\nMore events coming soon!",

    "content": "SFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nAuthor:\nKanaga Rajan\nSeptember 25, 2025\nPhoto Credit:\nJuan Montes\nIBM quantum resources open doors for hands-on learning and workforce readiness\nSan Francisco State University is the first California State University (CSU) campus to join the IBM Quantum Network, expanding opportunities for SFSU students and researchers to participate in quantum computing research and deepening classroom experiences.\nStudent researchers working with Computer Science Professor Wes Bethel — who leads the Department of Computer Science’s quantum computing work — can gain access to IBM quantum computing systems through two key Department of Energy (DOE)-supported initiatives at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). ORNL and LBNL are IBM Quantum Innovation Centers within the IBM Quantum Network. By having access to the IBM Quantum Network, Bethel hopes to provide some of his engaged students a new pathway to delve deeper into this field.\nIn addition to working with students on DOE-supported research projects, Bethel also teaches “CSC 647/747: Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science” where he uses various freely available resources to introduce quantum computing.\nFormer SFSU student and current LBNL computer systems engineer Chris Pestano (M.S., ’25) explained that he pursued a career in quantum computing because “within the next 10 to 15 years, you should be expecting a lot of major breakthroughs. I thought that’d be interesting to be a part of. That also provides a decent amount of job security.”\nBethel hopes to help more students join the quantum computing pipeline.\n“What we’re doing is workforce development for quantum computing,” Bethel said. “We need people who are capable and know what quantum computing is, how do you write codes for it, how is quantum computing different from classical computing, what are the challenges and software ideas.”\nHaving access to quantum computing resources through these DOE projects gives SFSU computer scientists, researchers and other students hands-on experience to contribute to the rapid progress to the nascent technology and emerging industy.\n“The trick is you need access to real quantum computing hardware. These are not things you can buy off the shelf,” Bethel explained.\nHe was able to apply and receive access to the IBM Quantum Network due to a DOE grant he received last year that funds his quantum computing research. It is part of a multi-institutional grant led by Talita Perciano at LBNL, that includes Bethel at SFSU and researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and is sponsored by DOE’s Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research.\nDOE facilitates agreements so supercomputing centers (ORNL’s Quantum Computing User Program and LBNL’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center’s Quantum Computing Application Network) have access to high-end IBM quantum hardware. To apply for access, researchers like Bethel must be DOE-funded.\nOver the past few years, Bethel has led efforts in the Computer Science department to develop and expand their quantum computing offerings. He’s already had a few graduate students like Pestano who pursued quantum computing-related work or studies after graduation.\n“One of the things he pointed out was that quantum computing is at the stage that’s comparable to modern-day computers post-World War II. He essentially said you’d be going in at the [field’s] infancy.” Pestano said. This idea was exciting to him.\nWhen Pestano started at SFSU, he wasn’t settled on a specific computer science career path. After enjoying Bethel’s graduate-level high-performance computing class, Pestano signed up for his quantum computing class. This naturally led to doing a master’s thesis with Bethel, he explains, noting that this was his first formal research experience. The project allowed Pestano to collaborate with and impress LBNL researchers. He was offered a job to continue his quantum computing work at the national lab.\n“I think it’s not only important to have these connections but also have the proactivity and will to bring that for the students. I think that’s why I liked Dr. Bethel’s class so much,” Pestano added. “He was able to bring in speakers that are currently in industry or in research that he knows. One of the members on my current team actually stopped by as a speaker in the quantum class.”\nBethel previously worked at LBNL as a computer scientist and is still an LBNL research affiliate. His interest in quantum computing began long before he was at SFSU, so he’s determined to help develop SFSU’s footprint in this space and prepare more students like Pestano.\n“From a student perspective, the program we have at San Francisco State is an entry point to a whole universe of technology and jobs and opportunities that have not been present before,” he said.\nLearn more about SFSU’s Department of Computer Science.\nRelated News\nSFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nSeptember 25, 2025\nCIDER Lab Wins First Prize at Kumo AI Hackathon\nSeptember 11, 2025\nAnnouncement of Two New Grants Awarded From NSF\nAugust 28, 2025\nProfessor Jozo Dujmovic authors new AI book from Springer Nature\nAugust 26, 2025",

It is developed for AI applications in the area of decision-support systems. If we want that machines can make decisions in a way similar to humans, then we must first understand the properties of human natural logic reasoning. That is the goal of Graded logic. Human reasoning is observable, measurable, modellable, and explainable. Based on observations and experiments with human subjects, Graded Logic includes unique mathematical models of graded propositional calculus. That is the essential component of the LSP method for evaluation, optimization, comparison and selection of complex objects and alternatives. Based on this methodology  we present applications in computational intelligence, in several decision-making areas, and discuss opportunities for further research, development, and industrial applications.\nBiography of Speaker\nJozo Dujmović received the Dipl. Ing. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering, and the M.Sc. and Sc.D. degrees in computer engineering, all from the University of Belgrade, Serbia. Since 1994 he has been Professor of Computer Science at San Francisco State University, where he served as Chair of Computer Science Department from 1998 to 2002. His permanent research interest is in logic foundations of soft computing and in decision support systems. In 1973 he introduced the graded logic concepts of andness and orness and graded logic aggregators based on continuous transition from conjunction to disjunction. He used these concepts to develop the Logic Scoring of Preference (LSP) method for evaluation, selection, and optimization of complex systems, as well as the complete LSP decision support software. He is the author of more than 190 refereed publications, a Life Senior Member of IEEE, and the recipient of NAFIPS, CMG, Informatica, and ETAN best paper awards. His most recent book Soft Computing Evaluation Logic was published by Wiley and IEEE Press in 2018. His industrial experience includes R&D work in the Institute “M. Pupin” in Belgrade, and consulting in the areas of soft computing decision methods, performance evaluation, and software design. He is a founder and principal of SEAS (seas.com), a company specializing in soft computing decision methods and software support for the LSP method.\nUpcoming Events\nMore events coming soon!",

These adversaries, powered by advanced network technology, perform large-scale connection tampering attacks seeking to prevent users from accessing specific online content, compromising Internet availability and integrity. In recent years, we have witnessed recurring censorship events affecting Internet users globally, with far-reaching social, financial, and psychological consequences, making them important to study. However, characterizing tampering attacks at the global scale is an extremely challenging problem, given intentionally opaque practices by adversaries, varying tampering mechanisms and policies across networks, evolving environments, sparse ground truth, and safety risks in collecting data.\nIn this talk, I will describe my research on building empirical methods to characterize connection tampering globally and investigate the network technology enabling tampering. First, I will introduce novel network measurement methods for locating and examining network devices that perform censorship. Next, I will describe a modular design for the Censored Planet Observatory that enables it to remotely and sustainably measure Internet censorship longitudinally in more than 200 countries. I will introduce time series analysis methods to detect key censorship events in longitudinal Censored Planet data, and reveal global censorship trends. Finally, I will describe exciting ongoing and future research directions, such as building intelligent measurement platforms.\nSpeaker Biography\nRam Sundara Raman is a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Roya Ensafi. His research lies in the intersection of computer security, privacy, and networking, employing empirical methods to study large-scale Internet attacks. Ram has been recognized as a Rising Star at the Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet (FOCI), and was awarded the IRTF Applied Networking Research Prize in 2023. His work has helped produce one of the biggest active censorship measurement platforms, the Censored Planet Observatory, and has helped prevent large-scale attacks on end-to-end encryption.\nUpcoming Events\nMore events coming soon!",

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in Italian\nPreparation for the Major\nThe Italian major consists of 30 units of upper-division coursework. Up to 14 units of lower-division coursework or demonstrated language proficiency is required for the major.\nProficiency can be demonstrated by completing the necessary lower-division courses,\nhaving taken the equivalent coursework elsewhere,\nor testing out.\nFor advising about placement, contact the Italian program coordinator at\nalbiero@sfsu.edu.\nMost upper-division courses with the ITAL prefix are conducted in Italian, and students are expected to use Italian in their speaking, reading, and writing.\nWriting in the Major\nStudents must complete the University’s GWAR requirement by taking\nMLL 400GW\n,\nCWL 400GW\n, or\nITAL 600GW\n.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the Bachelor of Arts in Italian:\nLanguage - Students will read, listen, speak and write in Italian at an intermediate to an advanced-intermediate level.\nLinguistics - Students will identify the basic grammatical structures and elements of Italian.\nCulture - Students will be familiar with Italian historical and cultural developments in relation to an international context.\nLiterature - Students will be familiar with Italian literary production in relation to an international context.\nItalian (B.A.)\n— 30-44 units\nLower-Division Core (0-14 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nITAL 101\nFirst Semester Italian\n1\n4\nITAL 102\nSecond Semester Italian\n1\n4\nSelect Two:\n6\nITAL 103\nThird Semester Italian\n1\nITAL 104\n1\nITAL 206\nItalian Conversation\n1\nMay be fulfilled by AP test credit.\nUpper-Division Core (15 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nITAL 305\nITAL 401\nItalian Culture and Civilization\n3\nSelect One:\n3\nITAL 510\nITAL 511\nMLL 325\nLinguistics for Foreign Languages\n3\nSelect One:\n3\nCWL 400GW\nApproaches to Comparative and World Literature - GWAR\nITAL 600GW\nMLL 400GW\nReading and Analysis of Cultural Texts - GWAR\nElectives (15 units total)\nLower-Division Elective (3 units)\nOne lower-division course in Italian (e.g.,\nITAL 250\n) or a related area upon advising.\nUpper-Division Electives (12 units)\nAny upper-division course in Italian (ITAL 300+) or related area upon advising.\nNote:\nA minimum of 30 upper-division units must be completed for the degree (including upper-division units required for the major, general education, electives, etc.). A student can complete this major yet not attain the necessary number of upper-division units required for graduation. In this case, additional upper-division courses will be needed to reach the required total.\nComplementary Studies\nRequired of all candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree in Italian are 12 units of Complementary Studies, which must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ITAL, and not cross-listed with ITAL. Complementary Studies for the Italian major can be satisfied via four possible routes:\n12 units in any foreign language other than Italian (may include up to three units of MLL prefix courses);\n12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (including CSU Study Abroad and SF State Bilateral);\n12 units of coursework taken as partial completion of a second major, a minor or a certificate;\n12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an Italian Program advisor.\nRelated disciplines typically include classics, linguistics, literature, humanities, philosophy, history, music, art history, education, Jewish studies, apparel design and merchandising, industrial design, and any aspect of greater Italy, Mediterranean, Italian-American or European studies.\nWhere a course with a non-ITAL prefix, (and not cross-listed with ITAL), is taken as a core requirement or elective for the Italian major, the said course may also (double) count towards Complementary Studies only via the Study Abroad option or the second Major/Minor/Certificate option listed above. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Foreign Language option are allowed a maximum of three units of overlap of MLL-prefix courses between Italian major and Complementary Studies units. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Related Subjects option are not allowed to double-count major and Complementary Studies units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor. For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Minor in Art History\nThe Minor in Art History gives students the opportunity to learn about the visual cultures of the past and present around the globe. The 18-unit degree offers a series of increasingly focused courses—200 level survey courses, more specialized 300 and 400 level lecture courses, and a 500 level Advanced Topics—in which students learn how to analyze and interpret visual art within diverse historical, social, political, and cultural contexts. The program takes advantage of the Bay Area's rich cultural resources, galleries, and museums. It provides students with skills and knowledge that will complement many other disciplines and major fields of study within the University. It enhances students’ career outlook by providing a versatile skill set including strong writing, oral communication, critical thinking and visual literacy, which are in demand in a variety of professions in the media, arts, and culture/service/education industries.

It is organized into the following administrative areas: Child and Adolescent Development; Family, Interiors, Nutrition & Apparel (FINA); Counseling; Criminal Justice Studies; Public Health; Kinesiology; Nursing; Physical Therapy and Clinical Laboratory Science; Recreation, Parks, and Tourism; Social Work; Sociology and Sexuality Studies; and the School of Public Affairs and Civic Engagement, which houses Environmental Studies; Gerontology; Public Administration; and Urban Studies and Planning.\nMission of the College of Health and Social Sciences\nThe College of Health and Social Sciences prepares students to help solve the most pressing and enduring issues confronting the well-being of individuals, families, communities, and society. Students, faculty, and staff participate in a learning process that fosters excellence in their professions and supports them in the pursuit of equity and social justice. To advance this mission, the College is committed to innovative teaching, scholarship, and service that inspires leadership for positive social change.\nVision of Scholarship\nConsistent with the social justice mission of the University, the hallmark of the College of Health and Social Sciences is its belief in the potential of scholarship to right a wrong - an act of intellectual advocacy to serve the public good, to wrestle with critical social problems, and to transform how individuals, communities, and institutions function – by disseminating the knowledge from basic, translational, and applied research and by advancing the practice of specific disciplines. This vision is best achieved when scholarship is supported as a faculty-initiated and faculty-driven process that emerges from their intellectual curiosity, expertise, social engagement, and professional identity.

    "content": "Scholastic Distinction\nUndergraduate Students\nSatisfactory Scholarship\nAn undergraduate student working for a baccalaureate degree is expected to maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 (C) or better in all work at San Francisco State University. To be eligible for a baccalaureate degree, a student must have a GPA of at least 2.0 (C) in:\nall courses completed at San Francisco State University,\nall courses completed at the college or university level, and\nall courses in their major.\nSemester Dean’s List\nEach semester the University recognizes undergraduate students who have attained high scholastic achievement. The following criteria are used:\nThe student registered for and completed a minimum of 12 semester units for the semester. Only those courses where A-F grades were assigned are counted.\nThe student attained a GPA of 3.25 or better for the semester.\nOnly resident courses are used in computing the grade point average.\nOnly grades for the semester under consideration are used in computing the grade point average.\nGraduation with Honors\nHonors are granted with the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, and Bachelor of Science. For students who entered the University beginning fall 1996, honors are based on the cumulative GPA at the time of graduation (across all units attempted, whether in residence or transferred from other institutions). The cumulative GPA is listed as the “Overall GPA” on a student’s Degree Progress Report. The level of honors granted is determined by the GPA earned in all University and college coursework attempted according to the following scale:\nA student whose GPA is 3.50 – 3.69 shall graduate\ncum laude\n.\nA student whose GPA is 3.70 – 3.84 shall graduate\nmagna cum laude\n.\nA student whose GPA is 3.85 or greater shall graduate\nsumma cum laude\n.\nNote:\nin the calculation of honors, GPA is not rounded up and is based on the actual student GPA.\nA preliminary honors list is compiled based on all coursework completed excluding the last semester. Those meeting honors requirements on this basis are designated on the commencement program as “candidates for honors.” The final honors list is compiled at the time of final clearance for graduation and is based on all coursework completed.\nPhi Beta Kappa\nPhi Beta Kappa, the oldest honor society in the United States, maintains a chapter at San Francisco State. Known as Omicron of California, the chapter grants membership, by invitation only, to students in their senior year. Requirements for membership as established by the Phi Beta Kappa Society in Washington, D.C., and by the campus chapter are:\nA student must have completed at least 100 semester units towards graduation.\nAt least 45 of those 100 semester units must have been earned at SF State.\nA student’s GPA must place them among the top students in the graduating class. Most initiates have earned a GPA above 3.7.\nA student must be majoring in one of the liberal subjects. That means the major normally would be in some subject taught in the College of Ethnic Studies, College of Health and Social Sciences, College of Liberal & Creative Arts, or College of Science & Engineering, although not all majors in those colleges are considered liberal subjects.\nA student must have earned at least 90 semester units of credit in liberal subjects as listed above.\nApplied, professional, or vocational courses cannot be considered as qualifying for Phi Beta Kappa membership. Work in business, broadcasting, studio arts, education, engineering, and journalism courses are considered \"professional.\"\nThe student’s coursework must include a broad spectrum of studies in the sciences, humanities, and behavioral and social sciences. Evaluators are looking for depth as well as breadth and will, consequently, expect to find that a student has taken some courses beyond a mere introduction to a given subject.\nA student must have completed at least 3 units of university-level mathematics. Remedial courses will not be counted. Math courses accepted for GE are not necessarily acceptable for Phi Beta Kappa. A partial list of acceptable mathematics courses includes:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMATH 110\nBusiness Calculus\n3\nMATH 124\nElementary Statistics\n3\nMATH 165\nConcepts of the Number System\n3\nMATH 226\nCalculus I\n4\nMATH 565\nConcepts of Geometry, Measurement, and Probability\n3\nDS 110\nCalculus with Business Applications\n3\nISED 160\nData Analysis in Education\n3\nPHIL 205\nFormal Logic I\n3\nPSY 371\nPsychological Statistics\n3\nor any course for which these are a prerequisite\nA student must have studied a foreign language and be able to demonstrate an ability to read and write in that language. Evaluators will look for evidence that a student has progressed at least through three semesters of a foreign language or equivalent at the college level. Some students may have entered SF State with 6 units of Advanced Placement credit in a language and could, therefore, go directly into a third-semester language course. Students who can demonstrate that their native language was not English may count English competence as fulfilling the foreign language requirement.\nAn interested student who meets these minimum qualifications should contact their adviser for possible nomination for membership in the society.\nThe selection process starts at the beginning of the fall semester of each year. Transcripts are reviewed and a final vote on all candidates is made by the entire Chapter no later than spring. Once this vote is taken, it is impossible to elect any more new members until the following spring. New members who accept the invitation to membership are initiated at a formal ceremony, and attendance at the ceremony is required. Persons graduated at the end of the fall semester may be considered for election during the spring semester immediately following graduation. Persons graduated earlier than one semester preceding the spring election process will generally not be considered for membership.",

    "content": "Deploy AI at the Edge to Bridge the Information Gap: Efficiency and Security\nMonday, March 03, 2025\nEvent Time\n02:00 p.m.   -  03:00 p.m.\nPT\nCost\nLocation\nSEC 210\nContact Email\ncs-dept@sfsu.edu\nOverview\nAbstract\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed various industries and will continue to deepen its integration into daily life. The increasing deployment of IoT devices and large-scale data collection present critical challenges in ensuring efficient AI model integration while maintaining security and user privacy. At the CIDER Lab, we are addressing these issues by exploring how AI can be effectively deployed at the edge to optimize both efficiency and security. Our research spans multiple domains, including wireless communication, cybersecurity, and real-world applications. In wireless networks, we enhance Physical Layer Security (PLS) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and improve spectrum sensing with deep learning techniques. In the realm of security, we focus on phishing detection and explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate DDoS attacks when deployed on edge devices. Beyond network security, we also investigate practical applications of Edge AI, such as using machine learning for waste classification, audio analysis with Edge LLMs, and leveraging AI-driven solutions for carbon reduction. By deploying AI at the edge, we aim to bridge the information gap, enabling real-time intelligence while overcoming resource constraints and safeguarding privacy. This seminar will provide insights into our latest research efforts and discuss the challenges and opportunities in developing secure and efficient Edge AI solutions.\nSpeaker Biography\nDr. Qun Wang is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at San Francisco State University and leads the CIDER Lab. His research focuses on Edge AI, wireless security, and intelligent network optimization, with applications in cybersecurity, IoT, and sustainable computing. He has worked extensively on deploying AI-driven solutions for secure and efficient communication, spectrum sensing, and resource-constrained edge computing. Dr. Wang has collaborated with industry and academic partners to advance AI-powered security and network intelligence.\nUpcoming Events\nMore events coming soon!",

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nElectrical Engineering BS + Electrical and Computer Engineering MS SF State Scholars Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "San Francisco State University Graduate Certificate in Ethical AI – Overview and Early Experiences\nThursday, October 10, 2024\nEvent Time\n05:01 p.m.   -  06:00 p.m.\nPT\nCost\nLocation\nSEC 210\nContact Email\ncs-dept@sfsu.edu\nOverview\nAbstract\nThis talk first overviews San Francisco State University’s (SFSU) Graduate Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence launched in Fall 2019 by combined efforts of the Computer Science department, department of Philosophy, and the College of Business. It is designed to offer both professionals and graduate students (matriculated or non-matriculated, AI experts or not) the opportunity to acquire a deeper grasp of the ethical, legal, policy, and technical issues of AI, thus enabling them to effectively participate in the development or auditing of ethical and trustworthy AI systems and applications across a spectrum of employment sectors. The talk then gives a bit more details on CSC 859 AI Explainability and Ethics class created and taught by Prof. Petkovic which is also a core class in the certificate. More on SFSU Graduate Certificate in Ethical AI can be found here\nhttps://bulletin.sfsu.edu/colleges/science-engineering/computer-science/certificate-ethical-artificial-intelligence/\nSpeaker Biography\nDragutin Petkovic (IEEE Life Fellow since 2018, IEEE Fellow since 1998) received Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from UC Irvine in 1983 in the area of biomedical image analysis, and B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering and multidisciplinary studies respectively from University of Belgrade, Serbia with emphasis on image and signal analysis. He is currently a professor of computer science at San Francisco State University (SFSU) since 2003 where he was computer science department chair from 2003 to 2015. In 2019, he founded and co-leads the multidisciplinary SFSU Graduate Certificate in Ethical Artificial Intelligence together with SFSU Department of Philosophy and School of Business. He was a founder and Director of SFSU Center for Computing for Life Sciences from 2005 till 2018 and collaborated on multiple NIH grants with Stamford University in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for bioinformatics. He held positions at VMware as a Senior Director, Applications, and as senior manager and researcher at IBM Almaden Research center, San Jose (1983-2000). His research focus included content based retrieval (he was founder of trend-setting IBM Query by Image Content QBIC project). For last 10 years his work combines AI and ease of use and has a goal to bring technology closer to people and users. Due to his concerns about the state of the ethics and trustworthiness of AI systems and their possibly negative implications to society, his recent focus is on explainable and trustworthy AI to which he contributes by papers, books, workshops, talks and importantly by education of broader community via SFSU Certificate of Ethical AI.\nUpcoming Events\nMore events coming soon!",

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in Theatre Arts\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Theatre Arts is designed to provide training for professional careers in theatre, dance, and many other performing arts. The combination of liberal arts and professional training also prepares students for graduate school, teacher certifications, interdisciplinary/avocational interests in theatre and dance, as well as professional pursuits in other milieus. Coursework is supported and enhanced by the hands-on nature of the department’s performance and production program. Students execute nearly all of the work on our School-sponsored productions.\nThe Theatre Arts major consists of 27 units of core requirements and an additional 18 elective units. Students are highly encouraged to meet regularly with their major advisor to select elective coursework that is most relevant to their career goals and they make efficient progress through the coursework.\nThere is no audition or portfolio review requirement to declare a major in Theatre Arts.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will develop sufficient ability in their area of specialty to be involved in the creation and presentation of public performances in the theatre.\nStudents will develop competence at thinking conceptually and critically about text, performance, and production.\nStudents will demonstrate a foundational understanding of playwriting and production processes, aesthetic properties of style, and the way these shape and are shaped by artistic and cultural forces.\nStudents will demonstrate basic competence in the theater techniques of movement skills, voice skills, scenery and properties, costuming and make‐up, lighting and sound, play development, leadership and organization for production– including intermediate to advanced competence in one or more areas of specialization in creation, performance, scholarship or teaching.\nStudents will demonstrate foundational knowledge of the historical and cultural dimensions of theater, including the works of leading playwrights, actors, directors, and designers both past and present.\nStudents will demonstrate foundational knowledge of a wide selection of theatre repertory including principal era, genres and cultural sources.\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to develop and defend informed judgments about theatre.\nTheatre Arts (B.A.)\n— 45 units\nCore Courses (24 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nTH A 132\nPerformance Workshop I\n3\nTH A 202\nTheatrical Script Analysis\n3\nTH A 347\nTechnical Theatre and Design\n3\nTH A 349\nElements of Production\n3\nTH A 401\nGlobal Theatre History I\n3\nTH A 402\nGlobal Theatre History II\n3\nTH A 405GW\nAnalyzing and Writing About Theatre - GWAR\n3\nTH A 690\nTheatre Making - SF State Repertory Company\n3\nAdvanced Topics in Theatre Studies (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nDANC 350\nDance Aesthetics: Cultural/Historical Perspectives\n3\nDANC 430\nSurvey of Ballet and Modern Dance History\n3\nDANC/ANTH 657\nEthnography of Dance\n3\nTH A 340\nPrinciples of Directing\n3\nTH A 341\nHistory of Directing\n3\nTH A 404\nMusical Theatre History and Literature\n3\nTH A 406\nThe Art of Comedy\n3\nTH A/DANC 408\nPerformance in Asia and the Asian Diaspora\n3\nTH A 409\nQueer Theatre and Performance\n3\nTH A 504\nHistorical Styles of Decor and Clothing\n3\nTH A 531\nAdvanced Topics in Theatre Performance\n3\nTH A/MUS 559\nWomen in Jazz\n3\nTH A/C W 605\nWriting and Performing Monologues\n3\nMajor Electives (18 units)\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Theatre Arts requires 18 elective units with the TH A prefix.

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nTheatre Arts BA + MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in Theatre Arts\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

Cooperative positions are arranged with the help of the program director and supervised by both the immediate work supervisor and a faculty coordinator from the student's area of academic interest. Participation in the Cooperative Education Program expands and enhances career opportunities through experience gained with employers and often helps focus academic objectives. Students receive competitive wages and earn academic credit while involved in their field assignments. Employment periods may be either full- or part-time. Participants begin the program by completing the preparatory Cooperative Education Colloquium course. Additional information may be obtained from the Cooperative Education Office.\nProgram Scope\nThis supplemental 25-unit certificate program is designed to give students the opportunity to develop educational objectives and career opportunities. Enrollment in the cooperative education colloquium course is a requirement for all students and is used as the basis for evaluation of student potential and interest. The certificate indicates to the employer that the University validates the student's work experience in cooperative education and substantiates the experience as professional development and job training. Students receive academic credit and salaried compensation.\nAll placements are academically relevant. Since the certificate program is tailored to the student's needs and specific major, information about various degrees and programs offered may be found under the appropriate department or center.\nCareer Outlook\nStudents who complete the certificate program typically have greater employment options and benefits.

    "content": "Master of Science in Computer Science\nProgram Description\nAll students share breadth requirements in the areas of computing foundations, computer systems, and software development. Students focusing on different areas then differ in the choice of courses that provide depth in the chosen area and the work done for the culminating experience. Students are expected to decide on a focus area prior to enrollment in the second semester. Integrated into the curriculum are significant team and project experiences. There are two options for the mandatory culminating experience, the master’s thesis or the applied research project.\nThe grading method CR/NC is allowed only for\nCSC 895\nor\nCSC 898\n. All other courses listed on the Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) form must be a letter grade.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will demonstrate a breadth of knowledge in Computer Science, as exemplified in the areas of systems, theory, and software development.\nStudents will demonstrate the ability to conduct a research or applied Computer Science project, requiring writing and presentation skills which exemplify scholarly style in Computer Science.\nElective Requirements\nAll students are required to include elective credits in their program. Electives include:\nAll upper-division or graduate courses offered by the Computer Science Department, including breadth requirement courses and\nCSC 897\nand\nCSC 899\n.\nCSC 893\nmay not count as an elective course.\nCourses from other programs such as biology, engineering, business, or mathematics may be accepted with the approval of the graduate advisor and culminating experience supervisor.\nNote:\nA maximum of 6 units of upper-division courses (numbered below 700) may be applied to the degree with the consent of the course instructor and graduate advisor.\nGraduate Seminar Requirement\nIn addition to curricular requirements, prior to enrolling in\nCSC 895\n/\nCSC 898\n, all graduate students are required to attend the Department Graduate Seminar series during one semester of their studies. These weekly seminars explore current topics in computer science research and assist students with choosing a topic for the culminating experience. Details for meeting this requirement may be found in the\nGraduate Studies Policy section\n.\nPracticum\nThis 1-3 unit option is chosen by students who wish to enhance their master’s degree by completing an industrial practicum. After finding the job in the local industry, the student will submit a research proposal to the department’s supervisor (normally the department chair) that describes the expected work and learning outcome. The department’s supervisor must approve the proposal before the student begins the research. Once approved, the student will enroll in 1 unit of\nCSC 893\n. At the conclusion of the work experience, the student must file a written report outlining the research and work experience. The report is submitted to the department’s supervisor. Students may repeat\nCSC 893\nfor a maximum of 3 units. The total number of units for the degree for students who complete the\nCSC 893\npracticum option will be 33 units. It is recommended that this option be pursued only during the summer.\nNote:\nCSC 893\nallows international students to obtain permission to work off-campus for the duration of the course.\nAdmission to Program\nAdmission to the graduate program in Computer Science is a two-step process that should be completed simultaneously:\nApply to San Francisco State University:\nComplete the on-line CSU Mentor application. Follow all other requirements for admission to the University by accessing\nwww.sfsu.edu/~gradstdy/\n.\nApply to the Department of Computer Science graduate program:\nFull details can be found at\nhttps://cs.sfsu.edu/grads/prospective-graduates\nWe encourage students with four-year degrees other than Computer Science to apply to our program as conditional applicants. Please check the link in Step 2 above for details.\nFinancial Assistance\nGraduate assistantships are occasionally available for qualified master's students. These opportunities include participating in funded research projects, assisting with the management of departmental and university computer laboratories as well as lecturer positions for beginning undergraduate computer science courses. Frequently, there are internship opportunities available for work at local companies. International students should address all questions related to their visa status and eligibility for practical training (off-campus work) to the\nOffice of International Programs\n.\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nLevel One\nComputer science students admitted to the M.S. program are required to satisfy English Level One prior to the end of their first year of study at SF State. Level One is satisfied by obtaining either a score of 4 or better on the GRE Analytical Writing Exam or a passing grade in\nSCI 614\n.\nSCI 614\nis strongly recommended for all students who wish to develop their skills in professional writing.\nLevel Two\nThe second level of proficiency in written English must be demonstrated before graduation. At this time, the student must demonstrate writing skills that exemplify scholarly style in computer science. This is demonstrated by the master's thesis or the research project report.\nPolicy on Enrollment While Conducting Directed Research\nPursuant to Policy F89-165 adopted by the Academic Senate in 1989, the Computer Science Department has adopted the policy that all graduate students who are working with a research advisor (above and beyond general advising during office hours) and/or having his/her thesis or project reviewed, must enroll in at least 1 unit of\nCSC 895\n,\nCSC 897\n,\nCSC 898\n, or\nCSC 899\n.

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in Literature\nEnglish majors are required to complete a 45-unit program consisting of 24 units of core requirements and 21 units in an area of concentration,\nincluding a 3-unit Culminating Experience capstone course. The four concentrations offered by the English Department are\nLiterature, Linguistics, English Education, and Professional Writing and Rhetoric.\nA maximum of\nsix\nunits of lower-division coursework may be accepted for credit in the English major upon permission of an advisor.\nAdvanced Placement (A.P.) credit in composition cannot be used to fulfill the six-unit lower-division requirement in the major.\nCompletion of\nENG 480GW\nwith a grade of C or higher fulfills the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) for all English majors.\nThe Culminating Experience capstone course must be completed during either the final semester or one of the semesters of the student’s final (senior) year, depending on the English major concentration.\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant major concentration section in this Bulletin.\nThe BA in English with a concentration in Literature offers students a historically grounded study of British, American, and “post-colonial” Anglophone literatures. Our core curriculum includes a series of two upper-division survey courses (Literature in English I and II) intended to provide students with a knowledge foundation of literary movements, figures, and forms within a transatlantic context. Literature majors also take one course in linguistics, an upper-division Shakespeare course, at least one course in literary theory or criticism, and at least one course in Anglophone literature produced outside of Britain or America.\nThe Literature program offers a wide range of courses centered on specific authors (Austen, Chaucer, Woolf), historical periods (“Age of Victorians,” “American Literature 1914-1960”), genres (“Detective Fiction,” “Post-Apocalyptic Science Fiction,” “Lyric Forms”), and other special topics (“18th c. Women Writers,” “Devils and Angels”), allowing students to pursue their individual interests and pleasures in fulfilling their elective units. No matter what the subject, all courses within the major foster students’ close reading, writing, and analytical skills. Literature majors can expect to hone their aptitude for writing, research, oral communication, and analytical thinking. This practical skill set prepares our majors for many career opportunities, including teaching, writing and publishing, law, information science, business and marketing, and more.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to differentiate how language use varies across the contexts and genres of professional writing and rhetoric, literature, and linguistics. (Disciplinary Knowledge)\nStudents will be able to formulate and pursue methodologically sound lines of inquiry, effectively placing their ideas side by side the ideas of others, drawing persuasively on credible primary and secondary sources. (Research)\nStudents will be able to produce rhetorically effective texts across a range of digital, print, and multimedia formats. (Written Communication/Digital Literacy)\nStudents will be able to carefully read and critically examine the ways in which culture and global context affect language, literature, and writing.

Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college.

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in Linguistics\nGeneral Information\nThe English Department at SF State provides opportunities for students to study in a variety of subfields that make up the English major. Join us and become part of a racially, linguistically, and culturally diverse community of learners engaging in a dialog between our histories and experiences, and new ideas and literacies.\nLinguistics is a concentration within the English BA. At the undergraduate level, students begin to explore the patterns of sounds, words, sentences, and conversations in a variety of languages and speech communities. What similarities are found between English, Spanish, and Swahili, for example? What patterns do Turkish and Japanese share? How can you characterize the difference between “empty” and “hollow” when the dictionary lists them as synonyms? How do conversations among teenagers in San Francisco differ from conversations among 40-year-olds?\nStudents interested in any field involving language analysis — including but not limited to law, education, anthropology, sociology, psychology, and linguistics — benefit from preparation in examining language data with the rigorous methods of the discipline. Students who plan to teach language to gain a valuable background in the structure of English along with a deeper understanding of how languages are acquired. Undergraduate majors are encouraged to take courses in other languages as well as courses investigating language from the perspectives of other fields, such as speech and communication, psychology, computer science, and anthropology.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to differentiate how language use varies across the contexts and genres of professional writing and rhetoric, literature, and linguistics. (Disciplinary Knowledge)\nStudents will be able to formulate and pursue methodologically sound lines of inquiry, effectively placing their ideas side by side the ideas of others, drawing persuasively on credible primary and secondary sources. (Research)\nStudents will be able to produce rhetorically effective texts across a range of digital, print, and multimedia formats. (Written Communication/Digital Literacy)\nStudents will be able to carefully read and critically examine the ways in which culture and global context affect language, literature, and writing. (Global Perspectives)\nStudents will be able to analyze language and texts in relation to the historical and social contexts in which they are situated. (Historical Thinking)\nStudents will be able to apply critical thinking, close reading, and rhetorical persuasion to engage productively and ethically in scholarly, civic, and professional communities. (Application & Engagement)\nStudents in the linguistics concentration will be able to demonstrate a solid understanding of the fundamental linguistic subfields of phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and sociolinguistics.\nStudents in the linguistics concentration will be able to analyze grammatical aspects of English and other languages unfamiliar to them.\nStudents in the linguistics concentration will be able to produce a field-appropriate research paper conforming to all writing conventions, citation conventions, and structural conventions in linguistics research.\nGPA Requirements\nStudents must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher in the major, and no grade in the major lower than a C- (except for\nENG 480GW\n, which requires a grade of C or higher).\nEnglish (B.A.): Concentration in Linguistics\n- 45 Units\nLower-Division Requirements (6 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 218\nLiterature Is Not A Luxury: Writing For Self and Community\n3\nENG 250\nTopics in Literature and Culture\n3\nUpper-Division Requirements (18 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 402\nIntroduction to Professional Writing and Rhetoric\n3\nENG 420\nIntroduction to the Study of Language\n3\nENG 461\nLiterature in English Since 1800\n3\nENG 480GW\nWriting in English: GWAR Seminar\n3\nENG 583\nShakespeare: Representative Plays\n3\nENG 640\nGlobal Texts and Practices\n3\nConcentration Requirements (21 Units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 421\nSyntax\n3\nENG 424\nPhonology and Morphology\n3\nENG 425\nSociolinguistics\n3\nElectives (9 units)\nThree courses selected with approval of advisor.\nCapstone Experience (3 units)\nThis course must be completed during the spring semester of the student’s final (senior) year.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 422\nHistory of the English Language\n3\nStudents must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher in the major, and no grade in the major lower than a C- (except for\nENG 480GW\n, which requires a grade of C or higher).\nComplementary Studies Requirement for English Majors\nTwelve units of Complementary Studies are required of all candidates in any of the four concentrations (Literature, Linguistics, English Education, and Professional Writing and Rhetoric) in the Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

Go to the following link to see what GE requirements are satisfied by these scores. Consult with your major department to see whether any of the credit can count toward your major.\nAP – IB – CLEP Test Credit\nArea 1: English Communication\n— 9 units\nStudents taking courses in fulfillment of Areas 1A and 1C will develop knowledge and understanding of the form, content, context, and effectiveness of communication. Students will develop proficiency in oral and written communication in English, examining communication from the rhetorical perspective and practicing reasoning and advocacy, organization, and accuracy. Students will practice the discovery, critical evaluation, and reporting of information, as well as reading, writing, and listening effectively.\nIn critical thinking (Area 1B) courses, students will understand logic and its relation to language; elementary inductive and deductive processes, including an understanding of the formal and informal fallacies of language and thought; and the ability to distinguish matters of fact from issues of judgment or opinion. In Area 1B courses, students will develop the abilities to analyze, criticize, and advocate ideas; to reason inductively and deductively; and to reach well-supported factual or judgmental conclusions.\nRequirements:\nStudents must complete a minimum of nine units in Area 1, including a minimum of three units in each of the following three areas: English Composition, Critical Thinking, and Oral Communication.

    "content": "Bachelor of Science in Business Administration: Concentration in Finance\nConcentration in Finance\nThe Finance concentration teaches students to recognize, understand, and attain the skills necessary to be successful in the world of finance. It focuses on the financial decisions made in every organization, which include investment, decisions in purchasing and selling real and financial assets, raising cash to fund these investments, and managing the risk of its assets and investments. Other operational decisions include implementing routine day-to-day procedures to manage all financial aspects of the organization and decisions regarding changes in the mix of its services and products. Although a financial manager specializes in these decisions, managers from across the organization also contribute.\nFour sets of skills are essential to financial decision-making: First, an understanding of the environment within which decisions are made, including both the internal structure of the organization and the nature of external capital and financial markets; second, familiarity with the organization’s information system, including accounting, financial, and human resources; third, analysis of available financial data to understand the likely impact of alternative decisions and their level of uncertainty; finally, understanding the interrelationships between financial decisions and decisions made in other parts of the organization, such as marketing, production, and IT.\nAll concentration courses must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Students must maintain an overall minimum grade point average of 2.0 across the seven concentration courses.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nBusiness Knowledge and Integration\nDemonstrate knowledge of core business disciplines and integrate concepts across functional areas to solve problems.\nBusiness Communication\nCommunicate business information effectively in written and oral formats for diverse audiences.\nCritical Thinking and Problem Solving\nApply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to analyze complex business situations and recommend reasoned solutions.\nQuantitative and Technological Proficiency\nUse quantitative methods and appropriate technologies to analyze data and support business decisions.\nTeamwork and Inclusion\nCollaborate effectively in diverse teams, demonstrating leadership and respectful communication in accomplishing team goals.\nEthics, Sustainability and Global Perspective\nEvaluate business decisions from ethical, sustainable, and global perspectives, considering diverse stakeholders and environments.\nBachelor of Science in Business Administration: Concentration in Finance\n— 69 Units Minimum\nExcept in cases of credit by examination, no more than 6 units of the core may be completed on a CR/NC basis.\nStudents must earn a grade of C- or better in core Business courses required as prerequisites for other core Business courses.\nAll concentration courses must be taken on a letter-grade basis.

For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nStudents should use their\nPathway/Category\nto determine which roadmap to follow. For directions on how to view your Pathway/Category, visit\nhow to find your pathway\n. Questions? Contact\nGator Smart Start.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 1/2\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 3/4\nTransfer Student Roadmaps\nFor students with an AS-T in\nBusiness Administration\nwith 18 units in the major satisfied.\nBUS ADT Roadmap with 18 Lower-Division Units\nFor students with an AS-T in\nBusiness Administration\nwith 15 units in the major satisfied.\nBUS ADT Roadmap with 15 Lower-Division Unit\ns\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "title": "Master of Fine Arts in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Master of Fine Arts in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts\nThe Department of Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts (BECA) Graduate Program is a premier program designed for students pursuing an advanced education in media arts, whether it be in television and radio production, writing, business, management, digital and multimedia production and content delivery, or pedagogy. This broad, theory-driven approach is designed to encourage students to think critically about the many facets of the media industry, the content they produce, and the impact it has on our culture and communities. BECA graduate students can pursue one of two degree options:\nThe 30-unit, two-year MA in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts reflects a comprehensive view of communication arts with an integration of theory and practice. The purpose of the MA is to offer students the opportunity to engage in advanced academic inquiry and scholarship in broadcast, electronic, and digital media, and to critically apply this knowledge to media and other fields. Candidates can choose from two culminating experiences: the comprehensive examination or a thesis.\nThe 60-unit, three-year MFA in Broadcast & Electronic Communication Arts complements the department’s 30-unit MA degree. The purpose of the MFA is to prepare students to practice and teach in the field. It emphasizes the academic intersection between theory, research, and practice. The culminating experience is a creative project, the possibilities of which can be television or radio scripts, fully produced television, podcasts, or radio programs, sound recording and design, and social media producing and marketing. ALL MFA students are expected to develop a personal aesthetic and develop conceptual clarity to include distribution (getting their work in front of audiences).\nThe degree path for all MFA students includes three foundation areas:\nBroadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Theory, History and Criticism\nBroadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Practice\nPedagogy in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts\nIndividualized programs for the BECA MFA degree are designed in consultation with the graduate advisor.\nGraduate students admitted conditionally to the MFA program will submit a portfolio for a creative project in their second year of study. If the faculty does not approve the portfolio, the student may apply to transfer to the MA program and graduate after completing all required MA coursework and the comprehensive exam. If the portfolio is approved, coursework from the MA program is applied to the MFA degree. The student will complete a third and final year to earn the MFA.\nAdmissions Requirements:\nSan Francisco State University requires applicants to graduate programs to have a GPA of 3.0 or better. Applicants with undergraduate degrees in all areas related to the media arts will be considered. Applicants who do not meet these criteria may petition the department for admission.\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nEach graduate student must demonstrate the ability to write standard American English correctly and effectively. To assure that each graduate student has the desired proficiency in written English, two distinct assessments are made:\nLevel One (Preadmission)\nLevel One writing is demonstrated with an Analytical Writing score on the GRE of 4.5 or higher. Students who fail to demonstrate Level One writing preadmission may be admitted conditionally but will be required to take a department-administered writing test during the first week of their first semester. If they fail to pass this writing test, they will be required to take remedial writing courses before enrolling in 700-level or 800- level courses other than BECA 700 and BECA 702. The remedial writing classes cannot be used on the ATC. This requirement may delay the student’s progress through the program.\nLevel Two\nAdvanced level of writing proficiency is demonstrated by successfully completing the MFA proposal and the analysis document that accompanies the creative project.\nRequired Admission Materials\nApplications to the department graduate program must upload the following items in Cal State Apply:\nA resumé or CV that summarizes your education, experience, specialized and general skills, awards, and recognitions.\nA personal statement (500 word maximum) that discusses why you are choosing this program, your aspirations as a media arts practitioner, your creative and theoretical influences (other artists, scholars, theorists, as well as personal experiences), and your goals upon completion of the BECA MFA.\nA treatment, script, or script outline that demonstrates your ability to conceptualize and articulate a media art project in written form.\nA digital portfolio of partial or completed media projects designed to demonstrates how you present yourself and your work.\nThree letters of recommendation from individuals that can attest to the quality of past work, future potential, fit with our program, and areas of interest or specialization that warrant our attention. At least one of these letters should be from a former professor\nUnofficial transcripts from all previous schools.\nInternational Students\nThe department welcomes applications from international students. Many distinguished alumni of the program are working in media industries around the world. International students should note the special requirements that pertain to them presented on these pages. Questions should be directed to the BECA graduate coordinator, the Office of International Programs, or the Division of Graduate Studies.\nTransfer of Units\nApplicants who have completed previous graduate work in electronic media arts may apply to transfer up to 12 post-baccalaureate units from another university into the MFA program. Transfer units are approved on a case-by-case basis by the graduate coordinator. These units cannot have been used to earn another degree.\nAdvancement to Candidacy\nIn order to advance to candidacy, applicants must be in classified graduate standing and have an approved ATC form on file.\nCulminating Experience\nThe MFA culminating experience must be a creative project, the scope of which is defined by the student in collaboration with a committee of three faculty members. The project may take the form of a production created for the broadcast and/or streaming of electronic and digital media, a script for such a production, or another type of product that employs broadcast, electronic, or digital media.\nIn the second year of graduate studies, students who are ready to begin the MFA Creative Project must submit:\nA portfolio with 3-5 comprehensive examples of past work or work in progress. These samples should be in the media formats intended for the creative project. However, samples of additional creative work outside the area of focus are also acceptable.\nA proposal for the culminating experience creative project. The proposal should include a rationale, theoretical foundation, methods, production schedule, and evidence that the student has the resources and skills to complete the creative project.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nPLO #1.

    "content": "Master of Arts in English: Concentration in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages\nOverview\nTESOL is one of three concentrations within the M.A. in English.\nThe M.A. in TESOL provides students with a solid grounding in theory, research, and practice of teaching English as a second or international language to diverse language learner populations.\nGraduate courses focus on theoretical foundations of the field: second language acquisition, pedagogical grammar, teaching reading and writing, listening and speaking, adult literacy instruction, curriculum and assessment development, and reflective teaching practice. In the culminating experience class (\nENG 895\n, students create a portfolio containing teaching materials, a statement of teaching philosophy, a capstone project paper as well as other materials relevant to their professional growth and careers.\nThe M.A. in TESOL prepares students for teaching in a variety of teaching and research positions. Most graduates of the program obtain positions teaching in community colleges, 4-year colleges, or universities both in the US and abroad. Some graduates also join programs such as the US State Department, ELFs, Peace Corps, and Fulbright ETAs. Graduates also work in a variety of language teaching centers, educational programs, and fields related to communication.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nEnglish M.A. students will critically evaluate scholarship using knowledge of disciplinary history, foundational theories, epistemologies, and scholarly debates to participate in professional communities of Composition, TESOL, and Linguistics.\nEnglish M.A. students will conduct principled inquiry (critical reflection, observation, and/or formal research) using appropriate methods and tools of analysis to address disciplinary questions and problems of practice.\nEnglish M.A. students will produce effective written and oral presentations that follow professional disciplinary standards of Composition, TESOL, and Linguistics.\nEnglish M.A. students will apply pedagogical knowledge and skills to the teaching of language, literacy, or linguistics.\nStudents in the TESOL M.A. concentration will articulate a coherent teaching philosophy that has been informed by practical experience and knowledge of relevant teaching principles and research.\nStudents in the TESOL M.A. concentration will create appropriate lessons and curricula for multilingual English language learners.\nStudents in the TESOL M.A. concentration will produce critical reflections on teaching practices and materials and how they embody educational values of ethics, social justice, diversity, and globalization.\nAdmission to Program\nApplicants submit all materials through the Cal State Apply portal (\nhttps://calstate.liaisoncas.com\n).\nApplication materials include:\nA\n1 to 2-page statement of purpose\n.

    "content": "Master of Science in Geosciences\nProgram Advisor: John Caskey\nThe Master of Science in Geosciences provides an advanced degree that prepares students to work in private industry or government agencies, teach in community colleges or high schools, or continue postgraduate studies leading to a doctoral degree at another university. The graduate program also gives professional geoscientists an opportunity to update and upgrade their job skills.\nThe School of the Environment’ faculty has expertise in geology, meteorology, oceanography, and paleoclimate –fields critical to understanding many environmental problems, such as air and water contamination, active faulting, coastal erosion, and global warming. There are no formal concentrations within the M.S. program, but most students choose to emphasize research that is aligned with the faculty area of expertise. We encourage students to work on interdisciplinary projects, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We also encourage students to develop linkages with other departments in the university, and with agencies and firms in the local region.\nAll students take courses in their respective areas of emphasis plus a common core of three courses:\nERTH 700\n, a multidisciplinary seminar that exposes students to current geoscientific research and literature, and\nERTH 701\nand\nERTH 702\n, which prepare students for thesis research, quantitative analyses and scientific writing. Thesis projects are expected to have a rigorous base in a geoscience discipline. Depending on the particular field and focus of study, these projects can involve laboratory research, fieldwork, theory development, numerical simulations or model development.\nRecent graduate research projects have focused on topics such as active faults in Death Valley, effects of climate change on regional aquifers, geomorphic controls on Bay Area streams, deformation associated with the San Andreas fault system, Pliocene–Pleistocene climate change, large-scale tectonic processes in the Himalayan Mountains, carbon cycling in the ocean, wave erosion at Ocean Beach, and characteristics of severe storms in California. We encourage students to work on interdisciplinary projects and develop interactions and collaborations with other departments in the University, other institutions and agencies, and private industry.\nWe strongly recommend that students plan a course of study before beginning the M.S. program, in consultation with a faculty advisor and the graduate coordinator.\nAdmission to the Program\nThe School of the Environment is committed to recruiting and supporting a diverse group of graduate students with the potential to develop into excellent scientists.  We offer limited financial support in the following ways:\nThe John A. and Anna Monteverdi Fellowship\nThe Monteverdi Fellowship provides one year of significant support to graduate students in the School of the Environment who are specializing in atmospheric science, oceanography, or climate science and who demonstrate outstanding academic merit and financial need. The fellowship award of $10,000 can be used to pay for tuition, fees, books, and any other expenses that you may incur.  A condition of the fellowship is that you register for 6 or more units each semester.\nThe Professor Emerita Karen Grove and Jay Ach Fellowship Teaching fellowship\nThe Grove/Ach Fellowship provides two years of significant support to graduate students who demonstrate exceptional promise of achievement in the M.S. program in Geosciences. The fellowship award of $10,000 per academic year (renewal for second academic year contingent on good research progress) can be used to pay for tuition, fees, books, and any other expenses that you may incur.  A condition of the fellowship is that you register for 6 or more units each semester.\nThe Department Teaching Fellowship\nThe Teaching Fellowship is designed to support students with a strong interest in strengthening their teaching and communication skills in addition to their scientific research.  The fellowship provides the opportunity to teach up to two sections for two years (contingent on strong student and faculty evaluations of their teaching).  Students with this fellowship will be required to attend\nSCI 750\nScience Teaching for Scientists I\n.\nOther Sources of Support\nDepending on available funding, the School of the Environment or individual faculty may be able to support additional students as Graduate Teaching Assistants, student assistant, or research assistants.\nApplication Process\nA critical step to being accepted to the MS Program in the School of the Environment is identifying a research mentor. We therefore strongly encourage students to email faculty they are interested in working with.\nTo be considered for admission to the master's program as a classified graduate student, applicants must:\nSatisfy the University admission requirements.\nHave a bachelor's degree in one of the geosciences (geology, meteorology, or oceanography) or a related discipline.\nHave a 3.0 GPA in their earned undergraduate degree or last 60 semester (90 quarter) units completed.\nProvide letters of recommendation from at least two people familiar with the applicant’s previous academic work and/or professional accomplishments.\nSubmit a statement of purpose. The statement should address the following questions\nWhat are your main research interests and why?\nWhich faculty member(s) are you interested in working with directly?\nDescribe your financial need\nDescribe your interest in teaching and/or your interest as working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant.\nApplicants lacking the appropriate background may be admitted as conditionally classified graduate students. These students must complete additional coursework that will not be counted toward the degree requirements. Conditionally admitted students may take courses but cannot file an Advancement to Candidacy (ATC) form until all deficiencies have been satisfied.\nAll application material should be submitted at\nhttps://www2.calstate.edu/apply\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nEach graduate student is required to demonstrate an acceptable level of written English proficiency on two levels:\nLevel One\nWritten English proficiency will be assessed on the basis of the Statement of Purpose.

Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Music: Concentration in Jazz/Ethnomusicology\nJazz/Ethnomusicology provides Music majors the tools to study, create, and teach responsibly from musical cultural perspectives that are not beholden to a Western European Classical tradition.  Jazz is intrinsic to African American (i.e. Black) history, and Ethnomusicology is an internationally recognized interdisciplinary field of musical research that focuses on the socio-cultural elements of (primarily oral) musical traditions of the world that resist the historical effects of colonialism, imperialism, and patriarchy.\nProgram Learning Outcomes:\nMusical Literacy. Students will demonstrate proficiency in reading, notating, and transcribing music by ear. Students will demonstrate critical listening abilities through describing, analyzing, and articulating artistic and perceptual aspects of music.\nPerformance. Students will demonstrate applied performance skills through accurate, and expressive instrumental or vocal performances.\nCreation. Students will be able to express compelling and original musical thought through arranging, composing, and improvising in a variety of styles and for a variety of purposes.\nCritical Understanding of Historical, Cultural, and Aesthetic Contexts. Students will be able to apply historical and cultural knowledge and aesthetic judgement in order to articulate significance and meaning in music within diverse contexts.\nTo analyze and perform jazz standards, along with discussion of important artists in jazz history.\nTo improvise and compose creatively with nomenclature and sensibilities of the jazz tradition.\nTo research and discuss the field of ethnomusicology, its history, theory and methodology, and apply its interdisciplinarity with other areas of the humanities in both written and performative ways.\nTo demonstrate critical cross-cultural perspectives regarding various socio-historical contexts of American jazz, and its relatedness to other global practices (particularly of the non-western world).\nBachelor of Music: Concentration in Jazz/Ethnomusicology - 65 units\nLower Division Core (20 units)\nFoundational (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 130/TH A 131\nThe Foundations of Music Theory\n3\nTheory/Musicianship (10 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 200/TH A 234\nFundamentals of Modern Musicianship\n3\nMUS/TH A 221\nEar Training I\n2\nMUS 222\nEar Training II\n2\nMUS 232\nDiatonic Harmony\n3\nPiano (2 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 201\nClass Piano I\n1\nSelect One:\n1\nMUS 202\nClass Piano II\nMUS/TH A 206\nBeginning Jazz/Pop Piano\nTechnology (2 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 237\nIntroduction to Music Technology\n2\nHistory (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 281\nThe American Musical Experience\n3\nUpper-Division Core (13 Units)\nCore (4 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 542GW\nMusic in Culture and Context  - GWAR\n3\nSelect One:\n1\nMUS 361\nCapstone Composition or Performance Project\nMUS 598\nSenior Thesis\nTheory (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nMUS 403\nChromatic Harmony\n3\nMUS 440\nJazz Harmony\n3\nMusic History (6 units)\nSelect Two:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nAFRS 514\nAfrican Musical Diaspora\n3\nAIS 320\nAmerican Indian Music\n3\nMUS 505\nMusic of the World's Peoples\n3\nMUS 506\nSurvey of Jazz\n3\nMUS 513\nAsian Musical Diaspora\n3\nMUS 515\nLatin American Musical Diaspora\n3\nMUS 550\nWestern European Music History from the Middle Ages to 1750\n3\nMUS 551\nEuropean and American Classical Music History of the 18th and 19th Century\n3\nMUS 552\nClassical Music History of Europe and the Americas in the 20th Century\n3\nMUS 558\nMusic of John Coltrane\n3\nMUS 559\nWomen in Jazz\n3\nConcentration Requirements (32 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nTake 4 units in any combination:\n4\nMUS 260\nApplied Music Lessons\nMUS 360\nAdvanced Applied Music Lessons\nMUS 270\nImprovisation Techniques\n2\nSelect One:\n2\nMUS 365\nInstrumental Performance and Research Seminar\nMUS 394\nVocal Performance and Research Seminar\n8 units chosen from\nMUS 370\n-\nMUS 380\n;\nMUS 386\n-\nMUS 390\n8\nMUS 431\nJazz Improvisation\n2\nMUS 445\nCreative Concepts in Music\n2\nMUS 524\nIntroduction to Ethnomusicology\n3\n3 additional units selected from the Music History options not already used to satisfy the Core\n3\n6 units of Electives on advisement\n6\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor.

Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Philosophy\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts\nDean: Dr. Ifeoma Kiddoe Nwankwo\nDepartment of Philosophy\nHumanities Building, Room 388\nPhone: (415) 338-1596\nWebsite:\nhttp://philosophy.sfsu.edu/\nChair: David Landy\nProgram Scope\nThe Department of Philosophy offers students a broad education in the history of thought, development of powerful reasoning skills, and opportunities to apply their insights and skills to areas of personal and professional interest.\nAn education in philosophy is beneficial in almost all parts of life. Generally speaking, philosophical education is eminently valuable for careers that call for analysis and evaluation of problems, smart solutions, critical and creative thinking and writing, and powerful advocacy of one's beliefs and values. Our degree programs develop students’ potential for independent thought and intellectual creativity. Philosophy students score extremely well on the admission tests required by various post-baccalaureate professional schools. A double major in philosophy complements and enhances other degrees, whether in the sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, or professional studies.\nStudents can choose a degree program that includes both general theories in the different philosophical fields and philosophy as applied in different areas of understanding (the B.A. in Philosophy), or a degree that intersects philosophy and religion with a focus on the diverse forms experiences of spirituality can take (the B.A. in Philosophy and Religion), or a program that emphasizes foundations of law, public policy, and rights (the B.A. in Philosophy with an Emphasis in Philosophy and Law).  The department’s programs also recognize students’ diversity of interests by allowing a great deal of flexibility in choosing program content\nStudents may double-major, combining the skills, perspectives, and knowledge acquired in the Philosophy major with a pre-professional, social science, liberal arts, healthcare, human services, liberal studies, education, business, biological, pre-medicine, physical or computer science degree.  A double major in Philosophy complements and enhances other degrees, whether in the sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, or professional studies.\nGraduate Program\nThe Master of Arts in Philosophy is designed for students wishing to extend their knowledge of, and competence in, philosophy; for students seeking a teaching career where the master’s degree is required; and for students who are planning to do further study elsewhere. The program is wide-ranging and flexible, enabling students to concentrate on a number of different areas within philosophy.\nCareer Outlook\nA principal reason for the study of philosophy and/or religion is the enrichment of one's own life and understanding. Fortunately, the study of philosophy is also excellent preparation for a variety of post-baccalaureate professional studies and careers in law, medicine, public policy and strategic planning, the helping professions, computer-assisted enterprises, and innovative business and non-profit organizations.\nThe broader outlook and the ability to think critically about larger issues that are fostered by the systematic study of philosophy and religion are often highly valued by commercial firms in their management-level personnel. Some students continue on to graduate work in philosophy or religious studies. SF State graduates are currently teaching in colleges across the country. And opportunities to teach philosophy in K-12 have increased as educators realize the importance of enhancing children’s critical thinking skills. The philosophy and religion program is a strong foundation for the helping professions, the ministry, and advanced studies in theology. The skills that are achieved by minoring in Philosophy or Philosophy and Religion are an excellent complement to most University major programs.\nProfessor\nMohammad Azadpur (2003),\nProfessor in Philosophy\n.

    "title": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in English Education  | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in English: Concentration in English Education\nGeneral Information\nEnglish majors are required to complete a 45-unit program consisting of 24 units of core requirements and 21 units in an area of concentration,\nincluding a 3-unit Culminating Experience capstone course. The four concentrations offered by the English Department are\nLiterature, Linguistics, English Education, and Professional Writing and Rhetoric.\nA maximum of\nsix\nunits of lower-division coursework may be accepted for credit in the English major upon consent of an advisor.\nAdvanced Placement (A.P.) credit in composition cannot be used to fulfill the six-unit lower-division requirement in the major.\nCompletion of\nENG 480GW\nwith a grade of C or higher fulfills the Graduation Writing Assessment Requirement (GWAR) for all English majors.\nThe Culminating Experience capstone course must be completed during either the final semester or one of the semesters of the student’s final (senior) year, depending on the concentration.\nFor more information, please refer to the relevant major concentration section in this Bulletin.\nThe\nBA in English with a concentration in English Education aims to help students develop the subject-matter knowledge to enter credential programs to become English Language Arts teachers at the secondary level, in a middle or high school. The program includes a range of literature classes, courses in the theory and practice of literacy teaching and learning, linguistics and communication classes, service learning in local public schools and a choice of an emphasis area (literature, drama, linguistics, or creative writing). The program culminates with students compiling reflective electronic portfolios, a capstone that emphasizes the constructivist philosophy of the program — the belief that students actively make meaning as they learn.\nIndividuals who want to become teachers who do not pursue the English Education concentration can establish English subject-matter competency by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers or earning a degree in English with any concentration. In some cases, parts of the CSET exam may be waived for candidates without an English degree they satisfy specific courses requirements (contact an advisor for more information).\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nStudents will be able to differentiate how language use varies across the contexts and genres of professional writing and rhetoric, literature, and linguistics. (Disciplinary Knowledge)\nStudents will be able to formulate and pursue methodologically sound lines of inquiry, effectively placing their ideas side by side the ideas of others, drawing persuasively on credible primary and secondary sources. (Research)\nStudents will be able to produce rhetorically effective texts across a range of digital, print, and multimedia formats. (Written Communication/Digital Literacy)\nStudents will be able to carefully read and critically examine the ways in which culture and global context affect language, literature, and writing. (Global Perspectives)\nStudents will be able to analyze language and texts in relation to the historical and social contexts in which they are situated. (Historical Thinking)\nStudents will be able to apply critical thinking, close reading, and rhetorical persuasion to engage productively and ethically in scholarly, civic, and professional communities. (Application & Engagement)\nStudents in the English Education concentration will achieve proficiency across English/Language Arts domains (Reading; Communications; Composition and Rhetoric; Language, Linguistics, and Literacy) as required for subject matter competency in English Education.\nStudents in the English Education concentration will demonstrate the pedagogical content-knowledge and dispositions appropriate for pre-service teachers.\nEnglish (B.A.): Concentration in English Education\n– 45 units minimum\nStudents must have a GPA of 2.0 or higher in the major, and no grade in the major lower than a C- (except for\nENG 480GW\n, which requires a grade of C or higher).\nCore Requirements (24 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nLower-Division (6 units)\nENG 218\nLiterature Is Not A Luxury: Writing For Self and Community\n3\nENG 250\nTopics in Literature and Culture\n3\nUpper-Division (18 units)\nENG 402\nIntroduction to Professional Writing and Rhetoric\n3\nENG 420\nIntroduction to the Study of Language\n3\nENG 461\nLiterature in English Since 1800\n3\nENG 480GW\nWriting in English: GWAR Seminar\n3\nENG 583\nShakespeare: Representative Plays\n3\nENG 640\nGlobal Texts and Practices\n3\nConcentration Requirements (21-22 units)\nApplied Linguistics (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 423\nLanguage Analysis for Language Teachers\n3\nENG 425\nSociolinguistics\n3\nENG 426\nSecond Language Acquisition\n3\nLiterature: Adolescent (3 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 655\nLiterature and the Adolescent Reader\n3\nLiteracy (3 units)\nIncludes 25 hours of community service learning.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 417\nAcademic Literacy and the Urban Adolescent\n3\nAdvanced Composition (3 units)\nIncludes 20 hours of community service learning.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 419\nAdvanced Composition for Teachers\n3\nMythology and Oral Traditions (3 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nAIS 162\nAmerican Indian Oral Literature\n3\nCLAS 230\nAncient Epic Tales\n3\nCWL 250\nFables and Tales\n3\nCWL 260\nMyths of the World\n3\nCWL 421\nCeltic Literature\n3\nENG 636\nMyth, Literature, and Adaptation\n3\nLTNS 435\nOral History, Community Memory, and Collective Stories\n3\nSpeech Performance (3-4 units)\nSelect One:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nCOMM 220\nIntroduction to the Performance of Literature\n3\nCOMM 553\nPerformance and Identity\n4\nCapstone Experience (3 units)\nThis course must be completed during the final semester and will include an English Education e-portfolio.\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nENG 688\nAssessment in English Language Arts\n3\nElectronic Portfolio\nCandidates in English Education must register for\nENG 688\nduring their final semester, when they will compile an electronic portfolio to demonstrate that they have met all of the core outcomes of the Single Subject Program. They should include artifacts—examples of their work, and faculty and peer comments on their work—and reflections that explicitly tie elements of the artifacts to the outcome statements.\nComplementary Studies Requirement for English Majors\nTwelve units of Complementary Studies are required of all candidates in any of the four concentrations (Literature, Linguistics, English Education and Professional Writing and Rhetoric) in the Bachelor of Arts degree in English. These units must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ENG, and must not be cross-listed with ENG. English majors will be offered four pathways for satisfying this requirement; each pathway is designed to facilitate graduation in a timely manner.\nForeign Language: 12 units in a single foreign language;\n2nd Major, Minor, or Certificate: 12 units of coursework taken as part of a second major, a minor or a certificate;\nStudy Abroad: 12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (such as CSU Study Abroad);\nRelated Subjects: 12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an English Department advisor.\nRelated subjects typically include (but are not limited to) Comparative and World Literature, Classics, Creative Writing, Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages, History, Journalism, and Women and Gender Studies, Communication Studies, Instructional Technology, or Marketing. For these related subjects, six units must be from classes in a non-literary related field.\nDepending on the concentration within the major, Complementary Studies pathway, and approval of a departmental advisor, up to 12 units from courses with non-ENG prefixes that count towards the Complementary Studies requirement may also count as English electives in fulfillment of degree requirements.\nStudents who have earned AA-T or AS-T degrees and are pursuing a similar B.A. degree at SF State are required to fulfill the Complementary Studies requirement as defined by the major department. Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor.

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nEnglish (English Education) BA + English (Composition) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nEnglish (English Education) BA + English (Linguistics) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nEnglish (English Education) BA + English (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Graduate Application and Admissions Procedures\nAdmission Procedures and Policies\nRequirements for admission to San Francisco State University are in accordance with Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3, of the\nCalifornia Code of Regulations\n. Complete information is available on\nthe California State University website\n.\nAll CSU applications must be submitted online on\nthe Cal State Apply website\n. An acknowledgment will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.\nImportance of Filing Complete, Accurate, and Authentic Application Documents\nSan Francisco State University advises prospective students that they must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire and financial aid forms. Further, applicants must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).\nUndergraduate Application Procedures\nProspective students applying for part-time or full-time undergraduate programs of study must submit a completed undergraduate application. The $70 nonrefundable application fee should be paid online at the time of application via credit card or PayPal and may not be transferred or used to apply to another term. An alternate major may be requested on the application if desired by the university. The applications of persons denied admission to an impacted university may be redirected to another university at no cost, but only if the applicant is CSU eligible.\nImpacted Programs\nThe CSU designates programs as impacted when more applications from regularly eligible applicants are received in the initial filing period (October and November for fall terms, June for winter terms, August for spring terms, February for summer terms) than can be accommodated. Some programs are impacted at every university which they are offered; others are impacted only at a few universities.\nCandidates for admission must meet all of the university's specified supplementary admission criteria if applying to an impacted program or university.\nThe CSU will announce during the fall filing period those CSUs or programs that are impacted. Detailed information on university and program impaction is available on the Impaction at the CSU website.\nEach university will communicate supplementary admission criteria for all impacted programs to high schools and community colleges in their application service area and will disseminate this information to the public through appropriate media. This information will also be published on the San Francisco State University website at\nsfsu.edu\n.\nApplicants must file applications for admission to an impacted program during the initial filing period. Applicants who wish to be considered for impacted programs at more than one CSU should file an application at each university for which they seek admission consideration.\nSupplementary Admission Criteria\nEach university with impacted programs or class-level admission categories uses supplementary admission criteria in screening applicants. Supplementary criteria may include rank-ordering of freshman applicants based on the combination of student's \"A-G\" GPA and supplemental factors or rank-ordering of transfer applicants based on verification of the Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) or Associate in Science Transfer (AS-T) degrees, the overall transfer grade point average (GPA), completion of specified prerequisite courses and a combination of campus-developed criteria. Applicants for freshman admission to impacted universities or programs may need to have a higher \"a-g\" GPA. In no case will standardized test scores be utilized in making freshman admission decisions.\nThe supplementary admission criteria used by individual CSUs to screen applicants are made available by the universities to all applicants seeking admission to an impacted program.\nImportance of Filing Complete, Accurate, and Authentic Application Documents\nSan Francisco State University advises prospective students that they must supply complete and accurate information on the application for admission, residency questionnaire and financial aid forms. Further, applicants must, when requested, submit authentic and official transcripts of all previous academic work attempted. Failure to file complete, accurate and authentic application documents may result in denial of admission, cancellation of registration or academic credit, suspension or expulsion (Section 41301, Article 1.1, Title 5, California Code of Regulations).\nApplication Acknowledgment\nOn-time applicants may expect to receive an e-mail acknowledgement from the universities to which they have applied within two to four weeks of filing the application.  The notice may include a request that applicants submit additional records necessary to evaluate academic qualifications. Unless specific written approval/confirmation is received, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another university.\nReservation\nThe University reserves the right to select its students and deny admission to the University or any of its programs as the University, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate based on an applicant's suitability and the best interests of the University.\nAppeal of Admission Decision\nSection 89030.7 of the California Education Code requires that the CSU establishes specific requirements for appeal procedures for a denial of admission. Each CSU must publish appeal procedures for applicants denied admission to the university. The procedure is limited to addressing university decisions to deny an applicant admission to the university.\nAdmission appeal procedures must address the basis for appeals, provide 15 business days for an applicant to submit an appeal, stipulate a maximum of one appeal per academic term, provide specific contact information for the individual or office to which the appeal should be submitted and indicate a time estimate for when the university expects to respond to an appeal. The appeal procedures must be included in all denial of admission notifications to students and must also be published on the university website.\nApplication Procedures\nGraduate and Post-Baccalaureate Application Procedures\nAll graduate and post-baccalaureate applicants (i.e., doctorate, joint Ph.D. applicants, master's degree applicants, those seeking educational credentials or certificates and, where permitted, holders of baccalaureate degrees interested in taking courses for personal or professional growth or seeking a second bachelor’s degree) must file a complete graduate application as described in the graduate and post-baccalaureate admission materials on the Cal State Apply website.  Applicants who completed undergraduate degree requirements in the preceding term are also required to complete and submit an application and the $70 nonrefundable application fee. To be assured of initial consideration by more than one CSU, it is necessary to submit separate applications (including fees) to each. All CSU applications must be submitted online via the Cal State Apply website. An acknowledgement will be sent to the applicant when the online application has been submitted.\nApplication Filing Periods\nTerms\nApplications First Accepted\nInitial Filing Period\nFall Semester or Quarter\nOctober 1\nOctober 1 - November 30\nWinter Quarter\nJune 1\nJune 1 - 30\nSpring Semester or Quarter\nAugust 1\nAugust 1 - 31\nSummer Semester or Quarter\n(\nMost CSUs do not admit students to summer term\n.)\nFebruary 1\nFebruary 1 - 28\nFiling Period Duration\nEach non-impacted university accepts applications until capacities are reached. Many universities limit undergraduate admission in an enrollment category due to overall enrollment limits. If applying after the initial filing period, consult the university admission office for current information\nApplication Acknowledgement\nOn time applicants may expect to receive an e-mail acknowledgement from the universities to which they have applied within two to four weeks of filing the application. The notice may include a request that applicants submit additional records necessary to evaluate academic qualifications. Applicants may be assured of admission if the evaluation of relevant qualifications indicates that applicants meet CSU admission requirements, and in the case of admission impaction, supplemental criteria for admission to an impacted program. Unless specific written approval/confirmation is received, an offer of admission is not transferable to another term or to another university.\nHardship Petitions\nThe university has established procedures for consideration of qualified applicants who would be faced with extreme hardship if not admitted. Petitioners should write to the university Admission Office regarding specific policies governing hardship admission. For more information about\nSan Francisco State Graduate Admissions visit their website\n.\nAll program-specific supporting materials for graduate applicants must be uploaded in\nCal State Apply\n.  Retroactive admission and/or award of degree or certificate is prohibited for students who complete coursework in a program to which they have not been officially admitted. Applicants seeking prerequisites for entry to a graduate degree program should contact the Division of Graduate Studies. The\nCal State Apply\nonline application system does not allow applicants to apply to more than one San Francisco State graduate program per application term.  If you are not selected for admission to your preferred program, contact Graduate Studies for an alternate program.\nApplicants seeking second baccalaureate admission must obtain written support for admission from the Academic Department Chair of the intended program of study and contact the Division of Graduate Studies for procedures and forms to be considered for admission.\nOfficial Transcript Requirement\nAll applications are reviewed based on unofficial transcripts uploaded to the Cal State Apply online application. Applicants offered admission must provide the Division of Graduate Studies with one official transcript from each college or university attended, including community college and study abroad coursework. Separate transcripts from each college or university are required even though one transcript may show coursework taken at another institution. Transcripts for coursework completed at San Francisco State are not required. Official transcripts must be submitted in envelopes sealed by the issuing college or university. Copies of transcripts or opened official transcripts will not be accepted. Official transcripts sent electronically from authorized agencies, such as Script Safe, eScript, and etranscripts, must be sent to\ngraddocs@sfsu.edu\n. Transcripts that have been submitted for admission or evaluation become the property of the University and are not returned or copied for distribution outside of the University.\nEntrance Examination/Standardized Test Scores\nThe University does not require applicants to complete an entrance examination as a condition for graduate admission; however, many departments or programs do require that graduate degree applicants submit results of the general or area tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) prior to admission. Check the department website for test requirements. Applicants are responsible for having the required examination results forwarded directly to the University or department. San Francisco State’s GRE institution code is 4684. Our GMAT institution codes are F87HP99 for the M.B.A., and F87HP10 for the Master of Science in Accountancy programs.\nPre-admission Writing Assessment\nThe University requires that all applicants meet a pre-admission (Level I) writing standard prior to entering a graduate program. Departments or programs stipulate the pre-admission writing standards appropriate to their discipline. Departments may require a specific score range on the analytical writing section of the GRE or GMAT or faculty will assess graduate-level writing with a department/program administered writing exam or essay. Students who do not meet Level I writing standards, but meet other admissions requirements, may be admitted with specific conditions stipulated by the department. Conditions for meeting Level I writing standards should be met no later than the second consecutive semester after admission.\nProgram Application Materials\nLetters of recommendation, statements of purpose, writing samples, and résumé materials required by the department or program must be submitted as part of your\nCal State Apply\nonline application. Check the department/program website for requirements.  All application materials submitted to the University, academic department, or graduate program become the property of the University and will not be returned. In selected cases in which an applicant has submitted a portfolio of original work for review by a program admission committee, the original works may be returned if the applicant makes the necessary arrangements with the department and provides a stamped, self-addressed envelope or package for return mailing.\nApplicants from Institutions without Regional Accreditation\nAn applicant who is a graduate of an institution without regional accreditation, or from an institution whose degree is not considered equivalent to a baccalaureate degree from this University in terms of quality and/or content (e.g., specialized, professional, or certain international institutions), may not be admitted directly to graduate or credential status at San Francisco State. Applicants from non-accredited institutions should contact the Senior Associate Director of Graduate Admissions to determine alternative preparation for graduate study. Additional coursework at the undergraduate level may be required. Information about regionally accredited universities can be found at\nthe Council for Higher Education website\n(\nwww.chea.org\n). International students should review the International Student Admission Requirements section below.\nAdmissions information\nGraduate and Post-Baccalaureate Admission Requirements\nAdmission Requirements\nGraduate and post-baccalaureate applicants may apply for a degree objective, a credential or certificate objective, or where approved, may have no program objective. Depending on the objective, the CSU will consider an application for admission as follows:\nGeneral Requirements — The minimum requirements for admission to graduate and post-baccalaureate studies at a CSU are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations.\nSpecifically, a student shall at",

For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Extensive Support Needs Credential: Special Education\nThe Education Specialist Preliminary Credential program in\nExtensive Support Needs\n(ESN)\nprepares K-12 teachers using research-based curricula and pedagogy to provide quality educational services to students with extensive support needs from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. The program has as its foundation the assumption that educational services for students with disabilities should be implemented in the least restrictive environment; and the goal of those services is to teach skills and arrange educational and social settings to increase the students’ ability to participate fully in school, home, and community environments.\nCredential candidates in this program must demonstrate their competence in providing quality educational services to students with extensive support needs\nincluding access to standards-based academic curricula and the use of\nsystematic, data-based approaches to instruction and models of curricular adaptation and social supports. Competencies in\nsupporting students in inclusive settings,\ninteracting effectively with families, and in developing educational goals using a transdisciplinary team approach are also essential components of the teacher preparation program. In addition, a three-semester sequence of clinical fieldwork and student teaching (600 total hours) ensures that teacher candidates are able to apply the knowledge and skills acquired through course content and assignments to the instruction of students with extensive support needs in urban school settings.\nAdmissions\nAdmission and credential requirements include the following:\nA baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university. (Required for admission)\nSatisfy Subject Matter Competency Requirement: Successful passage of the CSET Multiple Subjects Test or by completing a subject matter program prior to admission.

Students are introduced to human populations past and present and explore how our field can advance efforts in social justice. Anthropologists document, investigate and seek to understand cultures of other times and places, and they also play important roles in social and political debate and advocacy.\nUndergraduate majors explore the theoretical foundations, topical foci, and ethical questions of the discipline, gain an appreciation for diversity in lifeways, and acquire an understanding of how anthropology can benefit communities and lead to social change. Our department creates opportunities for students to practice experiential learning and carry out hands-on field and laboratory research.\nThe Minor in Anthropology complements a broad range of majors in the life sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities. You can complete the minor with courses in lower-division 5B, 3B, and 4; and upper-division physical/life science (5UD); arts and humanities(3UD) or social sciences (4 UD).\nCareer Outlook\nTraining in anthropology prepares students for a wide range of careers. Anthropology majors can gain an extremely wide range of skills – from osteological analysis to ethnographic research. Our graduates have gotten jobs in fields that include health and medical services, community organizing and advocacy, cultural resource management, museum research and education, urban planning, international economic development, environmental assessment, media, user experience (UX) research, market research, education, social work, investigative journalism, public policy, social services, early childhood education, and filmmaking.\nIf you’re wondering whether you can major in Anthropology and still pursue a career in law, medicine, research, teaching, or museum work – among many other possible fields – the answer is probably yes. For more insight into how Anthropology can prepare you for the careers that you find interesting, consult with faculty advisors.\nProfessor\nDouglass Bailey (2008),\nProfessor in Anthropology\n.

    "content": "Multiple Subject Credential Programs\nMultiple Subject Credential (MSC)\nThe Multiple Subject Credential Program (MSC) prepares candidates to teach in elementary school from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade. Our credential program provides MSC candidates with the pedagogical skills and content knowledge to support the social and academic development of all children. The MSC is grounded in culturally responsive pedagogy aligned with a social justice perspective. MSC candidates develop or advance the skills needed to support educational equity for all children. We offer several program pathways to obtain the Multiple Subject Preliminary Credential.\nTwelve units of the MSC can be applied to the following: Master of Arts: Concentration in Elementary Education or to the Master of Arts in Early Childhood Education. Students pursuing the Credential + MA must enroll in one of these two MA's concurrent with or within two years of completing MSC coursework.\nMultiple Subject Credential (MSC), Bilingual Authorization\nThe MSC, Bilingual Authorization allows bilingual-biliterate candidates to obtain an additional authorization to teach in a bilingual classroom setting from Transitional Kindergarten to fifth grade. Candidates must demonstrate listening, speaking, reading, and writing proficiency in the focus language (Cantonese, Mandarin, or Spanish).\nMSC Program Options\n1.\nThree-semester program\noffers either a daytime or evening option. Candidates are placed in learning communities that allow a cohort to enroll in sequenced coursework. Candidates are placed for student teaching in socially, economically, culturally, and linguistically diverse elementary classroom settings.\n2.\nOne-year, Summer Start Program\nis geared for full-time students who can immerse themselves in an intensive credential program. Students in this program are admitted beginning in the Summer term and continue into the Fall and Spring semester. Grounded in strong research-based practices and learning theories, the program provides candidates with opportunities to apply theories and instructional approaches in their student teaching practicum within weeks of starting the program. Some courses are organized in a module format allowing candidates to complete the program within one academic year. Subject Matter Competency & Basic Skills must be completed before the fall semester begins.\n3.\nInterns:\nThe California Commission on Teacher Credentialing provisional permit allows non-credentialed individuals to work as the teacher of record only if the teacher is enrolled in a credential program and meets other criteria. Hiring decisions are made entirely by the local school district.  If a candidate has an offer of employment and wishes to enroll in the intern program, the following conditions must be met:\na. A candidate must show evidence of completion of the Basic Skills requirement, Subject Matter Competency, and U.S. Constitution requirement;\nb. A school district must offer the candidate a teaching position at an elementary school site;\nc. A candidate must apply and be admitted to an accredited credential program;\nd. The candidate must complete 120 credit hours of credential coursework (equivalent to three 3-unit classes)\nOnce these conditions are met, the candidate must submit an application for the intern teaching permit to the Department of Elementary Education Intern Coordinator, who will review for approvals.  The Graduate College of Education Credential Analyst will then authorize the permit.\n*Note: Interns work at a slower coursework pace while in the credential program to permit full time employment\n4.\nBilingual Educators for Social Transformation (BEST) Spanish/English\n(Three semesters)\nBEST embraces concepts of social justice and equity with a focused philosophical stance representing critical pedagogy and rooted in bilingual education. BEST integrates culturally relevant pedagogy throughout coursework. The goals are to develop critical educators who are equipped with tools to analyze and develop agency about challenges Latinos have faced, while also recognizing and highlighting the successes of the Latino communities.  Candidates who complete this program receive the Multiple Subject Credential with a Bilingual Authorization in Spanish.\n5.\nChinese Bilingual Authorization\n(Three Semesters)\nThis option provides bilingual-bicultural courses in Chinese literacy and student teaching placement in Chinese bilingual classrooms. Students who complete this program receive the Multiple Subject Credential Program with a Bilingual Authorization in either Manadarin or Cantonese.\n*Note: International students are required to be admitted into a degree program and cannot be classified as credential only.  International students interested in obtaining the Multiple Subject Credential Program must apply and be admitted to the Master of Arts Program in Education: Concentration in Elementary Education + Credential.\n6.\nEarly Childhood Education Focus, Transitional Kindergarten to Third grade.\n(One academic year) Fall admissions.\nThis option provides an ECE focus, TK to third grade. However, the MS Credential qualifies candidates to teach TK to fifth grade. It is grounded in culturally responsive pedagogy.

Several courses will have modules focusing on instructional approaches for grades 4-5.\nEducative Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA)\nAll Multiple Subject credential candidates are required to pass the Educative Teacher Performance Assessment (edTPA) during the final student teaching phase to earn the California Multiple Subject Credential. The edTPA provides teacher preparation programs with a systemic approach to evaluate a candidate's competencies with the Teaching Performance Expectations.

Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Arts in German\nThe academic program leading to a B.A. in German offers a wide range of courses to meet the diverse needs of today's student population. The undergraduate curriculum includes coursework in language, literature, linguistics, and culture. In addition, students can select courses in translation and German for business. To ensure that all students develop advanced language competency, the German program places great importance on small-sized participatory classes, which maximize opportunities to communicate in German.\nInnovative teaching methods, films, multimedia, and online materials enhance classroom interaction and enrich the academic experience. In addition, excellent computer facilities and a Foreign Language Multimedia Lab provide support for our academic program.\nThe German major consists of a total of 44 units, including 30 units of upper-division coursework. Up to 14 units of prerequisite coursework or demonstrated language proficiency is required to begin the major.\nStudents may receive credit towards the lower-division requirements for the major with the appropriate scores on Advanced Placement Exams.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the Bachelor of Arts in German the student will:\nDemonstrate listening comprehension at the advanced level. Understand the utterances of native speakers and extract main ideas from recordings of authentic speech, including excerpts from lectures, films, radio, and television broadcasts.\nDemonstrate reading proficiency at the advanced level: Understand and summarize main ideas in target language texts intended for general readers, including social correspondences, general purpose essays, short stories, and news writing.\nDemonstrate speaking proficiency at the advanced level: Sustain a conversation on a general topic with a fluent speaker of the target language, narrate, and describe on a variety of topics at paragraph length, and respond to spontaneous developments in an exchange.\nDemonstrate writing proficiency at the advanced level: Produce narratives and descriptions, cohesive summaries, and routine social correspondences (e.g. business letters, resumes), demonstrating awareness of diction, syntax, and stylistics in the writing process.\nDemonstrate cultural knowledge: Understanding of cultural values, folk beliefs, social conventions and festive celebrations unique to target culture. Identify and characterize exemplars of painting, architecture, music, film, and other fine arts in the target culture. Identify major historical events and order them chronologically.\nGerman (B.A.)\n— 42 units\nRequired Courses (24 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nGER 101\nFirst Semester German\n3\nGER 102\nSecond Semester German\n3\nGER 206\nIntermediate German Conversation\n3\nGER 207\nIntermediate German\n3\nGER 305\nAdvanced Grammar and Composition\n3\nSelect One:\n3\nGER 330\nExploring the German Language\nMLL 325\nLinguistics for Foreign Languages\nGER 535\nThe German Novella of the 19th and 20th Centuries\n3\nMLL 400GW\nReading and Analysis of Cultural Texts - GWAR\n3\nUpper-Division Electives (18 units)\nAny upper-division course (GER 300+) can be counted as an elective.\nNote:\nA minimum of 30 upper-division units must be completed for the degree (including upper-division units required for the major, general education, electives, etc.). A student can complete this major yet not attain the necessary number of upper-division units required for graduation. In this case, additional upper-division courses will be needed to reach the required total.\nStudy Abroad\nStudents are encouraged to study abroad through the International Programs of the California State University. For students opting to study abroad, all study abroad units will count as units in residence and can be used for graduation credit. Up to 31 units required for the major may be taken through the CSU International Program in Germany. These units must be approved by a German advisor. A minimum of 9 upper-division units (GER 300+) must be taken at the home campus at SFSU.\nComplementary Studies\nRequired of all candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree in German are 12 units of Complementary Studies, which must come from courses bearing a prefix other than GER, and not cross-listed with GER. Complementary Studies for the German major can be satisfied via four possible routes:\n12 units in any foreign language other than German (may include up to 3 units of MLL prefix courses);\n12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (including CSU Study Abroad and SF State Bilateral);\n12 units of coursework taken as partial completion of a second major, a minor or a certificate;\n12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of a German Program advisor.\nRelated disciplines typically include linguistics, literature, communication, Jewish studies, philosophy, history, humanities, education, and any aspect of Europe.\nWhere a course with a non-GER prefix, (and not cross-listed with GER), is taken as a core requirement or elective for the German major, the said course may also (double) count towards Complementary Studies only via the Study Abroad option or the 2nd Major/Minor/Certificate option listed above. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Foreign Language option are allowed a maximum of 3 units of overlap of MLL-prefix courses between German major and Complementary Studies units.\nStudents satisfying Complementary Studies through the Related Subjects option are not allowed to double-count major and Complementary Studies units.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nGeneral Education Requirements\nRequirement\nCourse Level\nUnits\nArea Designation\nEnglish Composition\nLD\n3\n1A\nCritical Thinking\nLD\n3\n1B\nOral Communication\nLD\n3\n1C\nMathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\nLD\n3\n2\nArts\nLD\n3\n3A\nHumanities\nLD\n3\n3B\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nLD\n6\n4\nPhysical Science\nLD\n3\n5A\nBiological Science\nLD\n3\n5B\nLaboratory\nLD\n1\n5C\nEthnic Studies\nLD or UD\n3\n6\nScience\nor\nMath/Quantitative Reasoning\nUD\n3\n5UD\nor\n2UD\nArts or Humanities\nUD\n3\n3UD\nSocial and Behavioral Sciences\nUD\n3\n4UD\nSF State Studies\nCourses certified as meeting the SF State Studies requirements may be upper or lower division in General Education (GE), a major or minor, or an elective.\nAmerican Ethnic and Racial Minorities\nLD or UD\n3\nAERM\nEnvironmental Sustainability and Climate Action\nLD or UD\n3\nES\nGlobal Perspectives\nLD or UD\n3\nGP\nSocial Justice\nLD or UD\n3\nSJ\nNote: LD = Lower-Division; UD = Upper-Division.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor.

    "title": "Master of Arts in Spanish | San Francisco State University Bulletin",
    "content": "Master of Arts in Spanish\nThe M.A. program in Spanish is mostly focused on Spanish and Latin American literature and culture from the Middle Ages to the present. Over the course of their graduate studies in Spanish, students acquire a solid grounding in major works of poetry, prose, and theater, as well as the tools necessary to approach these works critically. All courses in the Spanish program are taught in Spanish. For more information, please see the graduate program website at\nhttps://spanish.sfsu.edu/spanish\n.\nAdmission to the Program\nIn addition to the requirements established by the University and the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures, a student must also meet the following admission requirements established by the Spanish M.A. Program.\nAll applicants are expected to have the equivalent of a B.A. in Spanish, that is, 30 units of upper division work in Spanish, with a GPA of 3.0 or better. If the student has not met this requirement, he or she may, at the discretion of the Program, be admitted as a “conditionally classified” graduate student. Students thus admitted must satisfactorily complete a number of specified courses before they become fully classified. These courses are not included in the 30 units required for the Masters.\nApplicants must arrange for two letters of recommendation to be sent to the program.\nApplicants must demonstrate to the Spanish faculty a record of prior scholastic achievement indicative of potential success as a graduate student. This means that applicants must submit a brief writing sample (essay) in Spanish or English which shows the scope of the applicant’s critical preparation and analytical ability. Ideally, this will be a\n1,000 to 1,200 word\npaper written in an undergraduate class.\nApplicants must also submit two copies of a brief statement of purpose (500 words), one written in English, the other in Spanish.\nApplicants are responsible for meeting the appropriate deadlines. Materials sent directly to the Spanish Program must be postmarked by April 1 to be considered for fall admission, or by October 1 to be considered for spring admission.\nWritten English Proficiency Requirement\nThe University has a requirement for written English proficiency that is to be assessed at two different levels.\nLevel One\nStudent admitted into each program must demonstrate, prior to the start of coursework, the ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues.\nLevel Two\nUpon completion of each program, candidates must demonstrate an improved ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues commensurate with the academic training received within the program.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nProficiency in Written English (Entry Level)\nStudent admitted into each program must demonstrate, prior to the start of coursework, the ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues.\nProficiency in Written English (Exit Level)\nUpon completion of each program, candidates must demonstrate an improved ability to write English correctly and effectively to explain, defend or argue discipline-specific issues commensurate with the academic training received within the program.\nUse of Appropriate Resources, Materials and Format for Writing a Research Paper\nStudents must demonstrate the ability to produce effective academic writing based on scholarly research.\nKnowledge of Culture, Language and Literature at the Advanced Level\nDemonstrate graduate-level competence in the concentration language.\nAnalyze texts for theme, structure, style and other aspects of prose and poetry.\nExplain how literary movements influence each other and are shaped by history.\nDemonstrate interdisciplinary approaches when analyzing complex problems and intellectual questions.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the present day structure of the concentration language,\nincluding the phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and discourse features.\nDemonstrate knowledge of the historical development and sociolinguistic variations of the\nconcentration language.\nDemonstrate the ability to develop basic skills as teacher-researcher while applying theoretical knowledge to practice, and to implement standard-based Second Language Acquisition (SLA) instruction.\nSpanish (M.A.)\n— Minimum 30 Units\nGraduate Courses (15 units)\nGraduate courses in Spanish (700-800 level)\nUpper-Division/Graduate Courses (6 units)\nCourses numbers 500 to 899.\nElective Courses (6 units)\nCulminating Experience (3 units)\nSelect one:\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nSPAN 896EXM\n&\nSPAN 899\nCulminating Experience Examination\nand Independent Study\n3\nSPAN 898\nMaster's Thesis\n3\nAt least five courses (15 units) must be graduate courses taken within the Spanish program. The balance of the units counted for the degree may include up to nine units of upper-division courses, graduate courses from other programs in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures, and a maximum of six units from a related field outside the department. Any courses taken outside the Spanish Program must have prior approval of the Graduate Advisor.\nWritten English Proficiency\nSince the Master’s Comprehensive Written and Oral Examinations are in Spanish, students must fulfill the Level-Two English requirement by passing\nMLL 701\nwith a B or higher. Students who do not receive at least a B must retake the course.\nCulminating Experience\nThe semester prior to taking the exams or submitting the thesis, students must have a pre-qualifying screening interview. This interview serves to assess the student's preparation. The committee is made up of three professors, at least two of whom must be members of the Spanish Program. After the screening interview, upon recommendation by the committee, the student passes to the next stage of the culminating experience.\nThere are two options for the culminating experience: OPTION A) After the screening interview, the candidate may request a copy of the questions for the written exam. Exam questions will be drawn from the list given to the candidate. The candidate will have a semester to prepare for the comprehensive exams. OPTION B) The candidate submits a three-page thesis proposal, an exhaustive bibliography (around 30 books and journal articles), and a brief outline. The candidate will then have six months to complete the thesis.\nFor OPTION A, comprehensive written exams are given twice annually generally at the end of November/April or the first week of May/December. The exam is given over two days and takes a total of five hours: three hours the first day and two hours the next. Students who pass the written exams will sit for their oral exam the following week. The oral exam takes one hour. For OPTION B, after completion of the thesis, the thesis defense takes one hour.\nFor more information, please see the program website at\nhttp://spanish.sfsu.edu\n.",

(Note: Students may not use an alternate prefix that is cross-listed with the primary prefix for the major.)\nCreative Writing majors will satisfy this requirement from within the major by taking 12 units of literature classes required in the major, which are recognized in the major list of any or all of the following prefixes: ENG, AFRS, CWL, LTNS, WGS, HUM, AAS, MGS, or AIS.\nStudents who have earned AA-T or AS-T degrees and are pursuing a similar B.A. degree at SF State are required to fulfill the Complementary Studies requirement as defined by the major department. Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap (4 Year)\nThe roadmaps presented in this Bulletin are intended as suggested plans of study and do not replace meeting with an advisor. For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with an AA-T in\nEnglish\nENGL ADT Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in English\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science\nThe Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science is designed for students intending to prepare for graduate school or direct entry into a career as an environmental scientist or environmental manager in industry or government. Entry to the major presupposes prior coursework comprising the high school equivalents of two years of algebra, one year of plane geometry, one-half year of trigonometry, one year of biology, and one year of physics and/or chemistry.\nThe Environmental Science curriculum comprises a core providing a foundation of science and methods courses—introductory earth systems and environmental science, biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics—as well as distributed electives in environmental science, environmental management, and analytical methods, and a capstone proseminar.\nENV 205\nprovides introductory research design, statistical and geospatial methods. Geospatial methods are then further developed in\nGEOG 603\n, which is a prerequisite for all advanced GIS classes. The GWAR course (\nENV 500GW\n) focuses on the physical and human dimensions of climate change, providing a rich source of topics for composition at the upper-division level.\nStudent progress toward the degree is aided in that some of these core classes also meet lower-division general education requirements.

For directions on how to view your Pathway/Category, visit\nhow to find your pathway\n. Questions? Contact\nGator Smart Start.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 1/2\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap – QR Pathway 3/4\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with an an AS-T in\nEnvironmental Science\n.\nENVS ADT Roadmap\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Minor in Philosophy\nThe department welcomes students from other majors or programs who wish to examine their personal philosophy, investigate the philosophies of others, or sharpen their skills as independent thinkers. The enterprise of philosophy develops a wide array of skills necessary for clarifying premises, uncovering presuppositions (one's own and those of others), weighing the pros and cons of conflicting values, and analyzing concepts and issues. Courses in philosophy serve to develop and enhance these skills. Some courses concentrate on specific philosophical issues. Others provide an overview of an entire area of human inquiry or endeavor (such as the sciences, the arts, political theory and law, medicine, social justice, and how our minds, senses, and emotions work) or of the philosophical foundations that characterize a historical period.\nA great number of the courses offered are not only appropriate as part of a philosophy major but are of special interest to students in other fields. These courses are designed to help students understand the theoretical frameworks, methodological presuppositions, and more abstract dimensions of the paramount areas of knowledge.\nEach student minoring in philosophy must take at least 15 units in philosophy, at least 12 of these being upper-division units.\nThe flexibility of the philosophy minor and the wide array of philosophy courses allows students to choose a course of study that best suits their interests and complements their major program. Students interested in either the philosophical understanding of a field of knowledge or in philosophy for self-understanding should feel free to consult the department chairperson or an advisor on appropriate courses.\nAll coursework used to satisfy the requirements of the minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nGain knowledge of the history or current state of the discipline of philosophy.\nDevelop a grasp of representative philosophical issues and ways of dealing with them.\nDevelop a capacity to apply philosophical methods to intellectual problems.\nMinor in Philosophy - 15 units minimum\nEach student minoring in philosophy must take at least 15 units in philosophy, at least 12 of these being upper-division units.\nAll coursework used to satisfy the requirements of the minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0.",

The program consists of eight specified courses that focus on conceptual, theoretical, and practical skills as well as overall knowledge of international business. Although the program does not lead to a degree in international business, it prepares students to seek a career or advancement in international business. The award of a certificate means the holder has completed the required courses at an acceptable level of academic accomplishment. The certificate indicates to a prospective employer that the University validates the certificate program in international business. Students who have specific educational or career needs may be allowed to vary the selection of courses in the program after consulting with and obtaining written approval from the program coordinator.\nAdmission Requirements\nSelection for admission to the program will be based on student objectives, academic background, and recommendations as appropriate.

These units must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ENG, and must not be cross-listed with ENG. English majors will be offered four pathways for satisfying this requirement; each pathway is designed to facilitate graduation in a timely manner.\nForeign Language: 12 units in a single foreign language;\nSecond Major, Minor, or Certificate: 12 units of coursework taken as part of a second major, a minor, or a certificate;\nStudy Abroad: 12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (such as CSU Study Abroad);\nRelated Subjects: 12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an English Department advisor.\nRelated subjects typically include (but are not limited to) Comparative and World Literature, Classics, Creative Writing, Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages, History, Journalism, and Women and Gender Studies. For this option, six units must be from classes in a non-literary related field.\nDepending on the concentration within the major, CS pathway, and with the approval of a departmental advisor, up to 12 units from courses with non-ENG prefixes that count towards the Complementary Studies requirement may also count as English electives in fulfillment of major requirements.\nStudents who have earned AA-T or AS-T degrees and are pursuing a similar B.A. degree at SF State are required to fulfill the Complementary Studies requirement as defined by the major department. Students should consult with a major advisor about how transfer units and/or SF State units can best be applied to this requirement in order to ensure degree completion within 60 units.\n4\nConsider taking a class combined with a laboratory or a separate lab to fulfill 5C if not already satisfied.\n5\nFirst-time freshmen must take one lower-division Area 4 course that meets US History (USH).\n6\nMajor Electives (9 units)\nThree courses selected with the approval of an advisor.",

Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree.\nEarly Childhood Studies (Care and Education) BA + Early Childhood Special Education Credential + Special Education MA SF State Scholars Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in Early Childhood Education\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",

    "content": "Prof. Daniel Huang Recipient 2023 Petkovic Family Teaching Excellence Award\nAuthor:\nDr. Wes Bethel\nMay 28, 2023\nProf. Daniel Huang of the SFSU Computer Science Department is the recipient of the 2023 Petkovic Family Teaching Excellence Award. Dr. Arno Puder, CS Department Chair, presented the award certificate at the 2023 CS Graduation Ceremony.\nThe award criteria includes consideration of feedback from students. Some of the feedback from over 1,400 votes includes comments like:\n\"Not only does the instructor get you excited about the subject, but was easily approachable for questions/comments throughout the semester.\"\n\"Through humor and experience, information was well communicated to the class, which is hard to do for teachers in the cs major. More lively and up-to-date on what a programmer feels than any other CS professor I have met.\"\n\"[He] Really wanted everyone to learn the material and he did that by giving multiple ways of teaching a particular subject and making sure everybody understood the subject.\"\nAbout the award: its purpose is to recognize achievements in teaching effectiveness, in creating an academic environment that fosters student learning, that makes use of high-impact and inclusive active learning techniques, and that contributes to improvement of CS instruction and curriculum. The award is generously provided by the Family of CS Professor Dragutin Petkovic, who has been a champion of the effort that faculty put into teaching.\nCongratulations Prof. Huang! Thanks to the CS students for providing such amazing feedback, and thanks to Prof. Petkovic for creating this award to recognize teaching excellence.\nRelated News\nSFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nSeptember 25, 2025\nCIDER Lab Wins First Prize at Kumo AI Hackathon\nSeptember 11, 2025\nAnnouncement of Two New Grants Awarded From NSF\nAugust 28, 2025\nProfessor Jozo Dujmovic authors new AI book from Springer Nature\nAugust 26, 2025",

Students take classes in Art History to develop skills in writing, research, and knowledge of the histories and institutions of art in a global context, and apply these skills to diverse areas of studio art production in order to acquire a broad background in various mediums and techniques.\nProgram Learning Outcomes\nThe Bachelor of Arts in Art (Concentration in Art History and Studio Art) Program Learning Outcomes are guided by core values that inform both studio art practice and art history. Upon graduation, students will be able to:\nUtilize diverse knowledge of studio and art historical practices integrating appropriate techniques, media, and processes to create artistic form with research, writing, and analysis.\nGain breadth of knowledge of art history globally: identify major artists, works, movements; define key terms, concepts, and theories; and understand diverse historical, social, political, cultural, and ideological perspectives.\nDemonstrate skills in critical thinking, formal analysis, and visual literacy to interpret and evaluate the meaning of art and visual culture.\nApply processes of experimentation (revision, refinement, critical reflection on successes and failures) to develop curiosity and imagination and self-directed research to create portfolios of artwork and/or writing.\nUnderstand the ethical dimension of artistic practice and scholarship within a global context and in relationship to the dynamics of power—including those of class, gender, race, and geopolitics—as expressed through visual, spatial, institutional, and ideological practices.\nSteps to Change Major\nJuniors or seniors who have declared another major, but wish to change their major to Art with a concentration in Art History and Studio Art must attend a major group advising session. Email\nsch_art@sfsu.edu\nfor information and advising session dates.\nFor students transferring from other institutions, a minimum of 12 units in residence is required.\nStudents should be aware that art practice is time-consuming and expensive. Instructional Materials Fees are required for most studio courses, and students may find themselves spending additional sums of money on their projects.\nStudio practice courses require hands-on practice and experience; this limits the number of students who can enroll in such courses.\nAdvising\nStudents are strongly encouraged to consult with a major advisor on a regular basis as they advance through the program. A list of departmental advisors and contact information can be found on the school’s website:\nhttps://art.sfsu.edu/advising\n.\nStudents are also advised to consult with the University’s Advising Center for information about General Education and other University requirements, as well as the Advising Resource Center in the College of Liberal & Creative Arts:\nhttp://lca.sfsu.edu/students#arc\n.\nJump to\nLower-Division Courses (12 units)\nUpper-Division Art History (12 units)\nUpper-Division Studio Art (12 units)\nGraduate Writing Assessment Requirement (3 units)\nArt Productions (1 unit)\nCapstone (3 units)\nGeneral Education Requirements\nBachelor of Arts in Art: Concentration in Art History and Studio Art\n— 43 units\nLower-Division Courses (12 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nArt History\n6\nSelect Two:\nARTH 201\nGlobal Art History I\n3\nARTH 202\nGlobal Art History II\n3\nARTH/HUM 205\nAsian Art History\n3\nStudio Art\n6\nSelect Two:\nART 210\nIntroduction to Digital Media Arts\n3\nART 222\nIntroduction to Textile Art\n3\nART 231\nIntroduction to Drawing\n3\nART 235\nIntroduction to Printmaking\n3\nART 240\nIntroduction to Contemporary Sculpture\n3\nART 245\nIntroduction to Ceramics\n3\nART 260\nIntroduction to the Darkroom\n3\nBefore advancing to the 300-level or higher courses or declaring a concentration, all majors must have completed the University’s lower-division requirements and the lower-division courses for the major, or equivalent.

For a more personalized roadmap, please use the\nDegree Planner\ntool found in your\nStudent Center\n.\nFirst-Time Student Roadmap\nTransfer Student Roadmap (2 Year)\nFor students with an AA-T in\nStudio Arts\nor\nArt History\n.\nARTS or ARTH ADT Roadmap\nThis degree program is an approved pathway (“similar” major) for students earning the ADT in Art History or  Studio Arts\nCalifornia legislation SB 1440 (2009) mandated the creation of the Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to be awarded by the California Community Colleges. Two types of ADTs are awarded: Associate in Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and Associate in Science for Transfer (AS-T).\nNote: no specific degree is required for admission as an upper-division student. However, the ADT includes specific guarantees related to admission and graduation and is designed to clarify the transfer process and strengthen lower-division preparation for the major.\nAn ADT totals 60 units and in most cases includes completion of all lower-division General Education requirements and at least 18 units in a specific major. (The Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental Science AS-T degrees defer 3 units in lower-division GE area 3 and 3 units in lower-division GE area 4 until after transfer.) Students pursuing an ADT are guaranteed admission to the CSU if minimum eligibility requirements are met, though not necessarily to the CSU campus of primary choice.\nUpon verification that the ADT has been awarded prior to matriculation at SF State, students are guaranteed B.A. or B.S. completion in 60 units if pursuing a “similar” major after transfer. Determinations about “similar” majors at SF State are made by faculty in the discipline.\nDegree completion in 60 units cannot be guaranteed when a student simultaneously pursues an additional major, a minor, certificate, or credential.\nA sample advising roadmap for students who have earned an ADT and continue in a \"similar\" major at SF State is available on the Roadmaps tab on the degree requirements page for the major. The roadmap displays:\nHow many lower-division units required for the major have been completed upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nWhich lower-division requirements are considered complete upon entry based on the award of a specific ADT;\nHow to complete the remaining 60 units for the degree in four semesters.\nStudents who have earned an ADT should seek advising in the major department during the first semester of attendance.\nGeneral Advising Information for Transfer Students\nBefore transfer, complete as many lower-division requirements or electives for this major as possible.\nThe following courses are not required for admission but are required for graduation. Students are strongly encouraged to complete these units before transfer; doing so will provide more flexibility in course selection after transfer.\na course in U.S. History\na course in U.S. & California Government\nFor information about satisfying the requirements described in (1) and (2) above at a California Community College (CCC), please visit\nhttp://www.assist.org\n. Check any geographically accessible CCCs; sometimes, options include more than one college. Use ASSIST to determine:\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy any lower-division major requirements for this major;\nWhich courses at a CCC satisfy CSU GE, US History, and US & CA Government requirements.\nRemedial courses are not transferable and do not apply to the minimum 60 semester units/90 quarter units required for admission.\nAdditional units for courses that are repeated do not apply to the minimum 60 units required for upper-division transfer (for example, if a course was not passed on the first attempt or was taken to earn a better grade).\nBefore leaving the last California Community College of attendance, obtain a summary of completion of lower-division General Education units (IGETC or CSU GE Breadth). This is often referred to as a GE certification worksheet. SF State does not require delivery of this certification to Admissions, but students should retain this document for verifying degree progress after transfer.\nCredit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or College-Level Examination Program courses: AP/IB/CLEP credit is not automatically transferred from the previous institution. Units are transferred only when an official score report is delivered to SF State. Credit is based on the academic year during which exams were taken. Refer to the University Bulletin in effect during the year of AP/IB/CLEP examination(s) for details regarding the award of credit for AP/IB/CLEP.\nStudents pursuing majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines often defer 6-9 units of lower-division General Education in Areas C and D until after transfer to focus on preparation courses for the major. This advice does not apply to students pursuing associate degree completion before transfer.\nTransferring From Institutions Other Than CCCs or CSUs\nReview SF State's lower-division General Education requirements. Note that, as described below, the four basic skills courses required for admission meet GE Areas 1A/A2, 1B/A3, 1C/A1, and 2/B4 in the SF State GE pattern. Courses that fulfill the remaining areas of SF State’s lower-division GE pattern are available at most two-year and four-year colleges and universities.\nOf the four required basic skills courses, a course in critical thinking (1B/A3) may not be widely offered outside the CCC and CSU systems. Students should attempt to identify and take an appropriate course no later than the term of application to the CSU. To review more information about the 1B/A3 requirement, please visit\nbulletin.sfsu.edu/undergraduate-education/general-education/lower-division/#AAEL\n.\nWaiting until after transfer to take a single course at SF State that meets both US and CA/local government requirements may be an appropriate option, particularly if transferring from outside of California.",
