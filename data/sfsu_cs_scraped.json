The department offers a broad curriculum covering the major areas of the computing discipline, integrated with soft skills such as teamwork and written/oral communication; students also gain experience working on group projects. Students are exposed to the fundamentals of computing architecture and computing theory, and focus their studies on the areas of software and systems development. Faculty work directly with students to help them develop the skills and knowledge of computing professionals.\nDepartment faculty are committed to teaching excellence. They remain current in the rapidly changing field of computing technology through continuing research and publications, direct consultation with local industries, and seminar programs that bring top researchers and industry leaders to campus to speak on current developments in the field. The Supervised Industrial Research Program, Practicum option, and other mechanisms provide opportunities for graduate students to complement their academic learning with real-world experience.\nThe department has an additional commitment to sharing its knowledge and skills with the rest of the University community, with local schools, and with community-based organizations in the Bay Area.\nThe Bachelor of Science program stresses a basic foundation in mathematics and physics, and a thorough study of the fundamentals of the discipline: software development, computer architecture, operating systems, programming languages, algorithms, and the theoretical foundations of computer science. A wide variety of elective courses such as mobile development, web/internet applications, bioinformatics, database systems, artificial intelligence, computer graphics, game development, and software engineering allow students to specialize in selected areas. Ethical and social issues of computing are discussed throughout the curriculum. Senior courses include group projects to better prepare students for future job markets. Courses are updated or added regularly to provide necessary training in the latest software technologies.\nThe Master of Science in Computer Science prepares students for a wide variety of careers in computing or related industries as well as for advanced study toward Ph.D. degrees. Our program combines a solid and practical curriculum with high-quality research and project-based activities. In addition to a general core covering the breadth of the computing discipline, students may focus on software engineering in globally distributed environments, computing applications for biotechnology and the life sciences, data mining/big data, and business applications.\nOur faculty maintain active publication records, with significant funding from government agencies (NSF, NIH, Department of Labor, etc.) and industry (Genentech, Microsoft, IBM, Arista Networks, Mozilla, etc.). Students actively engage in research projects, write papers, attend conferences, and participate in funding proposals. SF State’s Center for Computing for Life Sciences and several specialized laboratories provide research and project focus, as well as opportunities to collaborate with faculty and students from other SF State departments and industry. A new Entrepreneurship Program and Developers Prize supports the development of student projects into business or non-profit ventures.\nComputing Facilities\nCentral Facilities\nA network of Mac, Linux, and PC servers supported by SF State Information Technology Services\nA Linux server (unixlab) supported by SF State Information Technology Services, used for Computer Science courses\nWorkstation labs in the SF State J.
