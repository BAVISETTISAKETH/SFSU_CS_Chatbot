    "content": "Undergraduate Advising\nProper and timely advising has been shown to significantly improve students' success and graduation rate. We summarize here our advising process and mandatory advising checkpoints. Please refer to the advising process described under these undergraduate, graduate and transfer advising section.\nAdvising\nStudent Advising Guidance\nComputer science students are strongly encouraged to adhere to the following student responsibilities:\nFollowing the appropriate advising process to their standing, as described under these Undergraduate and Graduate sections.\nReading\nall emails\nsent from the computer science office and faculty.\nSeeking advising for any mandatory advising checkpoints.\nSeeking advising whenever a need arises, in a timely manner with respect to any deadlines.\nUndergraduate Advising\nIt is important and beneficial to take the opportunity to schedule timely advising for assistance and achieving success. Students should plan their program of study in the major with the help of a departmental advisor as soon as possible in order that the correct sequence of courses is taken and a proper set of electives is chosen. Students are advised that CR/NC grades are\nnot\nacceptable in courses to be counted for the Computer Science major or minor programs. It is also suggested that students consult with an advisor before selecting courses to meet the General Education requirements.\nUse Navigator to Schedule your appointment.\nWilliam Hsu can be reached via email only until 10/5/2025 for advising needs:\nwhsu@sfsu.edu\n.\nSee Navigator Appointment Guide for Computer Science on how to schedule your appointment.\nPlease email\ncs-dept@sfsu.edu\nif you are unable to access Navigator.\nTransfer Advising\nAdvising Tips\nFor your appointment with your advisor, please bring the following documents (if available, online documents are ok):\nTranscripts\nList of all major related courses with course title, semester taken, college taken at, and grades obtained.\nIf possible, please bring course descriptions, syllabus, text book title, and any other related course materials.\nUse Navigator to Schedule your appointment.\nWilliam Hsu can be reached via email only until 10/5/2025 for advising needs:\nwhsu@sfsu.edu\n.\nSee Navigator Appointment Scheduler Quick Reference Guide on how to schedule your appointment.\nPlease email\ncs-dept@sfsu.edu\nif you are unable to access Navigator.\nGraduation Advising\nGraduation\nSee the\nRegistrar's Office's web page\nfor details on the graduation process. If your DPR shows something missing, please schedule an appointment with an Advisor. Make sure to complete your Senior Electives.\nSenior Electives\nAll CSC majors must complete five 3-unit senior electives. Students may choose 15 units from among the following courses:\nCSC 520: Theory of Computing\nCSC 600: Programming Paradigms and Languages\nCSC 615: UNIX Programming\nCSC 620: Natural Language Technologies\nCSC 621: Biomedical Imaging and Analysis\nCSC 630: Computer Graphics Systems Design\nCSC 631: Multiplayer Game Development\nCSC 641: Computer Performance Evaluation\nCSC 642: Human-Computer Interaction\nCSC 645: Computer Networks\nCSC 647: Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Information Science\nCSC 649: Search Engines\nCSC 651: System Administration\nCSC 652: Introduction to Security and Data Privacy\nCSC 656: Computer Organization\nCSC 657: Bioinformatics Computing\nCSC 658: Programming Cafe\nCSC 664: Multimedia Systems\nCSC 665: Artificial Intelligence\nCSC 667: Internet Application Design and Development\nCSC 668: Advanced Object Oriented Software Design and Development\nCSC 671: Deep Learning\nCSC 675: Introduction to Database Systems\nCSC 676: Soft Computing and Decision Support Systems\nCSC 680: Application Development for Mobile Devices\nCSC 690: Interactive Multimedia Application Development\nCSC 698: Topics in Computing\nCSC 699: Independent Study\nMATH 400: Numerical Analysis\nMATH 425: Applied and Computational Linear Algebra\nMATH 448: Introduction to Statistical Learning and Data Mining\n*Most graduate CSC courses may also be used as senior electives.\n**You may only choose one of the listed MATH courses as a senior elective.\nStudents are advised to check their university and college regulations regarding academic standing requirements. It is occasionally possible to use a course taken in a different department or at another university to satisfy elective requirements. Any course substitutions must be approved in advance by a Senior Advisor.\nOutside of SF State Transfer Students\nOur program has been recently revised to streamline the course articulation for transfer, allowing more courses taken at community colleges or other schools to count towards your Computer Science Degree at SF State.\nTransferable Courses\nAll lower division courses (course numbers below 300) included among the degree requirements are available at many community colleges in California. Students intending to enter the program upon transferring to San Francisco State University from a community college should take as many of those courses there as possible.\nThe equivalents for the following Computer Science courses may be taken from approved universities and applied to your SF State CS Degree:\nCSC 101: Introduction to Computing\nCSC 215: Intermediate Computer Programming\nCSC 220: Data Structures\nCSC 230: Discrete Mathematics\nCSC 256: Machine Structures\nAdditionally, the following non-CS courses, required for completion of the program, may also be transferred from other institutions depending on their respective department's policies:\nMATH 226: Calculus I\nMATH 227: Calculus II\nPHYS 220/222: Physics I\nPHYS 230/232: Physics II\nBIOL 100: Introduction to Biology\nTo verify course equivalencies, please consult\nassist.org\n.\nQuickly look up articulation agreements for CS courses\nusing this tool\n.\nIf all lower-division major and GE requirements are satisfied, check out the\nSF State Bulletin's Roadmap for Transfer Students\n.\nExpected Programming Knowledge\nStudents who transfer to our program should have adequate Java experience. Students can attain adequate Java background by taking a course which should include topics as specified in the resources below:\nThe main Java tutorials website:\nOracle Java Tutorial Documentation web page.\nTopics Include:\nOracle Java Tutorial Documentation: Getting Started\n(Study All Topics)\nOracle Java Tutorial Documentation: Learning the Java Language\n(Study All Topics)\nOracle Java Tutorial Documentation: Essential Java Classes\n(Study Exceptions and Basic I/O)\nOracle Java Tutorial Documentation: Collections\n(Study Introduction and Interfaces)\nForms\nUndergraduate Forms\nIf you are submitting a\nWaiver of College Regulations Petition form\n, please follow the instructions below:\nSTEP 1: Student fills out the petition form electronically:\nhttps://registrar.sfsu.edu/sites/default/files/documents/collegewaiver_1.pdf\nMake sure Course information is correct\n.\n(ex.
