    "content": "Readmission\nThe Division of Graduate Studies invites you to reapply to your graduate program. You must use the Graduate Studies Express Readmission Form PowerForm through DocuSign. This process exempts you from the Cal State Apply application process and exempts you from the $70.00 fee. You must obtain support from your Graduate Coordinator and designate the coordinator as a signatory to the PowerForm.\nGraduate Studies Express Readmission Form PowerForm\nInstructions for form\nConsult with\nyour graduate coordinator\nbefore submitting form\nEnter your name and email address\nEnter the name and email address of\nthe graduate coordinator for your program\nComplete all sections of the Graduate Studies Express Readmission Form\nSign\nIf the graduate coordinator for your program approves and signs this form, it will be routed to the Division of Graduate Studies. You will be readmitted within 3-5 business days after approval. You will be notified by email and official letter.\nReadmission Requirements\nReadmission to a graduate program is not guaranteed. Students must obtain the support of the Graduate Coordinator for the program of study. San Francisco State graduate students must reapply for admission to the University and the department/program if:\nthey have been absent for two consecutive regular (spring/fall) semesters as a matriculated student; and/or\nthey have attended another college in any interval of their absence.\nTo be considered in attendance for any semester, the student must be enrolled in at least one class through the end of the twentieth day of instruction.\nIn order for previously matriculated SF State graduate students to be eligible for readmission, they must have earned a GPA of 3.0 or better in all coursework attempted in graduate status and, if applicable, all coursework attempted at other colleges during their absence. If more than seven years have passed since the first semester of admission, applicants for readmission must first submit a\nPetition for Extension of the Seven-Year Limit\nin order to determine whether courses taken will be allowed for use towards the degree. The dean of the Division of Graduate Studies and the department have the right to deny any previous coursework taken beyond the seven-year limit. If a student has attended any other educational institution following attendance as a matriculated student at San Francisco State, transcripts must be submitted for all academic work undertaken since the student last attended SF State. Students applying for readmission must have been in ‚Äúgood standing‚Äù at San Francisco State and must have been making continuous progress toward the degree before leaving their program. Students wishing to re-enter with a GPA lower than 3.0 must improve their GPA by taking courses through Open University before reapplying.\nReadmission Policy:\nhttps://bulletin.sfsu.edu/graduate-education/admissions/\nüìë\nWelcome Back!\n‚úÖ Submit Proof of COVID-19 Vacination/Exemption Form\nSubmit Your Proof of COVID-19 Vacination or Exemption Form\nSF State is committed to the health and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff.
