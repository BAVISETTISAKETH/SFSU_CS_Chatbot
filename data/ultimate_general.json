Are there opportunities for growth?\nWork Environment:\nDo you like the physical work environment? Do you feel comfortable with your future supervisor and fellow employees? Is your supervisor likely to be a good mentor? Do your values and lifestyle correspond with the values and culture of the organization?\nOrganization:\nWhat is the organization's reputation? Is the organization growing or downsizing?\nCompensation:\nWhat is the total compensation package (base salary and benefits)? Does the salary meet your financial needs and obligations? If the salary is low, are there opportunities for significant responsibilities and advancement? What benefits are offered, i.e. healthcare, vacation, sick time, etc.?  Be aware that some smaller employers offer creative benefits to attract good employees including stock options, transportation costs, free meals, flextime, telecommuting, etc.\nSalary Negotiations\nDon't be afraid to negotiate your offer! The employer expects it. Check out websites such as\nGlassdoor\n,\nSalary\n, or\nLinkedIn Salary\nto explore salary ranges by job title and location. See how years of experience, industry, location and more can impact your salary and use this to support any salary negotiations you make.\nSalary Negotiation Handout",

    "content": "Exhibits\nWaters Run Deep\nFine Arts Gallery, Fine Arts Building Room 2398, San Francisco State University\nAug. 10 through Sept. 7, 2024\nThe Fine Arts Gallery at SF State will present the exhibition Waters Run Deep from Aug. 10 through Sept. 7, 2024. Waters Run Deep explores the mythical and mystical properties of water. Guest curated by Rogelio Cruz (B.A., 2024), the exhibition features Maëlis Bekkouche, Alexis C. Garcia, Lindsay Gauthier with Fog Beast, Tiare Ribeaux, Ana Paula Teixeira and Jessica Tully.\n60% of the human body is made up of water, and 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. Water, in every shape and form, is a building block for life on Earth, and its importance has been recognized by many, both in the physical by sustaining life, but also in the spiritual. Water is critical in many religious and ritual practices around the world. This manifests as deities dedicated to bodies of water and rain, cleansing rituals and the recognition of the integral connection of water and life.\nThe artists included in Waters Run Deep explore their own personal, cultural and metaphysical connections to water. Maëlis Bekkouche's \"Fish Woman\" is a video performance describing her connection to the ocean, as she covers her body in fish skins and transforms into who she calls \"fish woman.\" This connection is further exemplified by her sculptural work recycling fish and animal bones. Alexis C. Garcia's short film \"Daughter of the Sea\" follows the story of grief and healing through reconnecting to Yemaya, the Orisha who controls the oceans in Yoruba spirituality. Lindsay Gauthier with Fog Beast's \"These Lines Are Living\" is a film based on a series of performances commissioned by Headlands Center for the Arts. \"These Lines Are Living\" is the inaugural presentation by Fog Beast (Melecio Estrella and Andrew Ward) of a series of outdoor, site-specific performances that began at shorelines across the Bay Area in 2020. Multi-generational and participatory, \"These Lines Are Living\" brings attention to how our bodies, communities and governing institutions interact with and conceptualize shorelines in a time of accelerating climatic and social change. The film of the performance that we will be screening was created by Lindsay Gauthier. Tiare Ribeaux's \"Pō'ele Wai (As The Water Darkens)\" is a short film about a weaver who experiences a transformation when they find their drinking water has been poisoned by fuel leaking into O‘ahu’s watersheds. In \"Ulu Kupu,\" Ribeaux emphasizes the sacredness of wai (water), and the rainforests that hold our watersheds. Depicted through video, photography, sculpture, botanical art, paintings, and kapa, our interconnectedness and responsibility to the elements that sustain us is offered as a remembrance to the viewer, along with a respect for the land we inhabit and are stewards of. Ana Paula Teixeira, Puerto Rican photographer Ana Paula Teixeira, centers her photography around women of color, frequently photographing them in different bodies of water and using imagery that is undeniably inspired by the afro-indigenous cultures of the Caribbean. Jessica Tully's \"Submersion: The Secret Language of Water\" documents a site-specific performance ritual and video installation reconnecting Jewish women's 4,000-year-old purity rites with the contemporary water practices of the artist and her secular grandmother during the late 1970s.\n\"Waters Run Deep\" showcases the work of emerging curator Rogelio Cruz. Rogelio was born and raised in Sonoma County. From an early age discovered his love for the visual arts and dance, and he recently graduated from San Francisco State University majoring in Fine Art and minoring in Dance. He views his personal art practice as a ritual, one that allows him to connect to the earth, himself and his ancestral ties. His vision is that this collection of work captures the importance of prioritizing and celebrating our personal connections to the element of water. Life began in the ancient oceans, and it is in the waters that we can reflect on the sacredness of our own existence.\nThe exhibition program at SFSU Fine Arts Gallery positions emerging and mid-career artists from the Bay Area in conversation with national and international artists to consider global issues. Ever seeking to broaden the canon of contemporary art and future art histories, the SFSU Fine Arts Gallery centers on the presentation of artists of diverse backgrounds and lived experiences",

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | Undergraduate Advising Center",
    "content": "Frequently Asked Questions\nHave a question?  We can help.  These are some commonly asked questions and some of the things to consider.  If you need more assistance, feel free to reach out to your advisor.\nWhere should I go for advising?\nCampus Advising Centers\nFirst-year freshmen\nContact your assigned counselor in the UAC.\nUndeclared students\nContact your assigned counselor in the UAC.\nChanging your major or Special Major\nCall the UAC front desk to schedule an appointment.\nSophomores, juniors, seniors\nContact:\nassociated with your major for general advising and/or your faculty advisor for major advising (refer to your\ndepartment website\nfor contact information). <---- ?\nReturning students\nIf you plan to return to SF State after being out of attendance a year or more, call the UAC’s Virtual Front Desk to schedule a Readmission appointment.\nHow do first-year freshmen and undeclared students find out who their assigned advisor is in the UAC?\nRefer to your SF State email account to find messages from your assigned counselor in the UAC with instructions on how to connect with them throughout the year.\nHow many units should I take?\nFull-time status is 12 units but if your goal is to graduate in 4 years, plan to complete at least 30 units each year. For example, some students take 15 units in the fall semester and 15 units in the spring semester so they earn 30 units by the end of their first year at SF State.\nHow do I balance college with the rest of my priorities?\nPrioritize the things that are important and be realistic about your time. A full-time schedule (12 units) requires you to set aside at least 40 hours per week for class and study time. Students with part-time jobs generally do not work more than 20 hours per week if they are attending college full-time.\nWhere can I find more information about SF State majors?\nThe\n1\nst\nSemester Recommendations by Major\non the Advising Hub is a good starting place for your research about majors at SF State. Each page includes FAQs and links to degree requirements/roadmaps in the University Bulletin and the major department website.\nWhen should I declare my major?\nOnce you decide on a major, it is best to declare as soon as possible. For non-impacted majors, you can declare at any time. Impacted majors may have deadlines so you should connect with the major department for information about their declaration process (refer to the\ndepartment website\nfor contact information).\nWhat is an impacted major and how do I know if a major is impacted?\nWhen a major is impacted, it means that more students than can be accommodated want to declare the major. Students have to apply and be accepted into impacted majors so if you are interested, you should connect with the major department for information about how to declare (refer to the\ndepartment website\nfor contact information). For a list of impacted majors, refer to\nfuture.sfsu.edu/impaction\n.\nWhere can I find information about careers that are associated with my major of interest?\nThe\nCareer Services and Leadership Development\noffice and their team of career counselors offer individualized career counseling, workshops, events, and more. This is an excellent campus resource for all undeclared students to connect with during their first semester and beyond.\nWhat courses should I take if I am undeclared and have no majors in mind?\nDuring your first year, taking lower division (courses numbered 100-299)\nGeneral Education\ncourses are a great way to explore potential majors and choosing courses from a variety of different GE areas can help create a more balanced schedule.  Try to identify GE courses from departments you might be interested in.\nWhat do I take if I have a major in mind?\nTo explore a major, it may be possible to take introductory major courses or prerequisites for the major.  Refer to the\n1\nst\nSemester Recommendations by Major\non the Advising Hub for course recommendations from the major department.  You can take an introductory major class for a few majors if you have more than one in mind as long as you meet prerequisites.\nCan I use GE requirements to satisfy major/minor requirements?\nYou can use courses to meet multiple requirements (i.e. GE and major), however, units for the course will only be counted once.\nWhat is a minor and how can I add one?\nA minor is a focused area of study that does not require as many units as a major and is generally between 12-24 units. To add a minor, connect with the minor department to learn about their declaration process and timeline (refer to the\ndepartment website\nfor contact information).\nCan I double major?\nIt may be possible for students to complete two majors if they can complete both degrees without exceeding 120 units. You will need to connect with the departments of both majors for approval (refer to the\ndepartment website\nfor contact information).\nWhat is a special major?\nThe Bachelor of Arts: Special Major is an interdisciplinary program offered by San Francisco State University for students who have unique and well-defined academic goals which cannot be satisfactorily attained through one of the undergraduate major programs at SF State or with a major and minor combination.\nLearn more about the special major!",

    "title": "Long-Term Strategies | Student Success and Graduation Initiative",
    "content": "Long-Term Strategies\nOur campus strategy to increase course availability includes three components:\nCourse Availability and Curriculum\nOur campus strategy to increase course availability includes three components:\ndata-informed analysis of student course demand to enable effective curricular planning;\na fully funded curriculum, including increased funding for lecturers, GTAs and tenure-line faculty to teach required courses in high-demand major and general education requirements; and\nsupport for programs to analyze and restructure their curriculum and course pedagogy—with a special focus on prerequisites, requirements, quantitative reasoning and electives—in order to reduce students’ excess unit load and advance their progress to degree, academic achievement and success.\nAdvising\nThe second-most identified barrier to timely graduation, according to the senior exit surveys, is inadequate advising. In response, Academic Affairs conducted an operational review of advising in 2015-16, which utilized student surveys, focus groups and analysis by external consultants. We are preparing to implement a number of improvements including:\nhiring new advisors in both the central Undergraduate Advising Center (UAC) and the college-based resources centers;\nconducting a review of advising that takes place in other administrative units;\nraising funds to renovate the existing UAC to be a more accessible and welcoming space for our students;\nimplementation of a data management system to facilitate more strategic, case-management-based advising; and\nproactively identifying students in need of assistance earlier in each academic term.\nStudent Success Data\nOur plan to develop a more strategic advising system necessitates a responsive, accessible platform that makes student success data available to departments, colleges and the central administration in order to monitor and address student degree progress. Data will be captured in “real time” and longitudinally by:\nclass cohort, to track impact of large scale interventions over time;\ntargeted student communities, to ensure that we close and keep closed any opportunity gaps;\nmajor/program, to ensure ongoing curricular and co-curricular improvements are achieving intended goals and outcomes; and\ncourses/sections, to help improve teaching and learning outcomes.\nFirst Year of College\nSF State experiences its highest levels of attrition in the lower division, when 34% of our beginning FTF students leave without a degree before beginning their junior year. In order to increase retention rates, we plan to:\nexpand academic and social engagement;\nassist students in identifying appropriate majors;\nreduce health and wellness barriers; and\nincrease student success in the first year.\nTargeted Support Services\nTo enhance our capacities to improve student engagement, new personnel resources needed include but are not limited to:\nexpansion of Metro academies across the campus;\ntutoring, particularly in writing and math;\nsupplemental instruction aligned with high failure-rate courses;\nhealth, including mental health, and recreation professionals to improve student wellbeing, decrease stress and increase active learning capacities;\na first-year faculty director to collaborate with the FYE director being hired in Student Affairs and Enrollment Management; and\nfaculty resources to teach first-year seminars and meta-major courses.\nFaculty Hiring and Development\nIf SF State can accomplish any of our SSGI goals, we need to:\nmaintain an adequate number of faculty to support the curriculum;\nprovide the professional development neccessary to support student learning and retention efforts; and\nimplement a hiring strategy that targets bottleneck courses and highly enrolled major programs.",

    "content": "SFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nSeptember 24, 2025\nPhoto Credit:\nCourtesy of Poh Si Teng\nPoh Si Teng honored as executive producer of ‘Patrice: The Movie’\nSan Francisco State University couldn’t be a better place to learn about global culture, diversity and politics. For alumna Poh Si Teng, this campus fostered her journalistic pursuits from the classroom to Malcolm X Plaza, where you can see SFSU’s social justice ethos come to life. Teng (B.A., ’07) won her first Emmy Award earlier this month, as an executive producer of “Patrice: The Movie,” honored for Exceptional Merit in Documentary Filmmaking at the Creative Arts ceremony.\n“Truly, I couldn’t have chosen a better university and home,” Teng said. “I think back on all the classes and all the professors and all the protests and movements that I was part of, and I’m so proud and glad that I went to SF State.”\nTeng entered SFSU as an international student from Malaysia. She wrote for the\nGolden Gate Xpress\n, the University’s student-run newspaper, and she appreciates the diverse, supportive faculty members in the Department of Journalism, including Cristina Azocar, Erna Smith and Venise Wagner. Teng also credits SFSU with helping her land numerous internships that propelled her career.\n“I think about my time at SF State a lot,” she says. “It is foundational to who I am today. I’m so glad that was the first place I landed in the United States, which led me to the path of being a journalist, and then documentary filmmaker.”\nTeng would become a reporter for The New York Times, where she garnered her first Emmy nomination, and later, a documentary commissioner for Al Jazeera English, where she was nominated for an Academy Award for the documentary short “St. Louis Superman.” After a decade in journalism, she left the newsroom and became a grants director for the International Documentary Association. At IDA she created a grant for filmmakers with disabilities, with the support of the Ford Foundation. It was her time working with the disability film community that led her to championing “\nPatrice: The Movie\n” at ABC News/Disney. The documentary follows a disabled couple who risk losing their benefits if they get engaged or married. Teng was the lead creative executive at ABC News/Disney who brought the film to Hulu.\nLast year, Teng left her position at Disney/ABC to start her own production company. She is producing a three-part docuseries that she developed, and she is directing a political and medical verité film that is set in the U.S. and Gaza.\n“SFSU gave me the real-life experience of being close to the issues that mattered,” she said, “because the students were living them, whether it was the struggle to pay rent, the fight for disability rights or the weight of America’s foreign wars. I learned not just what to care about, but how to fight. That education continues to guide my work today.”\nLearn more about the SFSU Department of Journalism\n.\nTags\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts\nJournalism\nalumni\nAlumni News\nRelated News\nDiscover 2025: See what makes life brighter at SFSU on Oct. 18\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU offers full scholarships for first-of-its-kind PK-12 certificate in climate justice education\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025",

    "content": "Where Activism Meets Scholarship\nThe Department of Women and Gender Studies examines the power relationships between gender formations and political economies, cultural productions and embodiments. Understanding gender as co-constituted with race, class, sexuality and nation, the department deploys an interdisciplinary and transnational methodology to build feminist archives, conversations and tools for social justice.\nOur students engage in challenging academics, work closely with professors and lead community initiatives.\nWhy Women and Gender Studies at San Francisco State?\nGroundbreaking Spirit\nCollaborative Environment\nEngaged Faculty\nSan Francisco State University has offered classes relating to women's studies since 1971. In 1976 the Department of Women and Gender Studies was founded, becoming one of the first such departments in the United States.\nLearn more about our department.\nWe encourage intellectual collaborations within the department, as well as across the profession, and also support applications for internal and external funding to support research productivity.\nLearn about our WGS Emergency Scholarship.\nFaculty typically teach three courses per semester, maintain an active research and publishing profile, and advise undergraduate and graduate students in the department.\nMeet our faculty\nor\nfind advising\n.\nExplore Our Programs\nDonate to WGS\nHonoring Marjorie Stern\nOur department honors Marjorie Stern, a single mother who worked to provide for her four children while also attending San Francisco State University at the age of 36. She put her ambitions on hold after high school to become a homemaker after being discouraged from attending college by her family. However, this did not stop Marjorie from pursuing her dreams despite her circumstances. She received her bachelor's from SF State and graduated 4th in her class in 1958.\nAfter college, Marjorie became a teacher and taught at Galileo High School for 22 years. She also taught about women and unions/labor force for 5 years at CCSF and 1 year at SFSU. She was a strong advocate for women’s rights, especially in education. Marjorie was a founding member for both the American Federation of Teacher’s (AFT’s) Women’s Rights Committee, where she served as the Chairwoman from 1971 – 1974, and Coalition of Labor Union Women (CLUW). Marjorie established her own Scholarship at SF State and bestowed it upon our very own Women and Gender Studies Department. She wanted to give back and provide students the same opportunity she had at SF State where she was not discriminated against for her age or her gender. In recognition of Marjorie’s achievements, she was inducted into SF State’s Alumni Hall of Fame in 1995. Her photo still hangs in the first-floor lobby of the Administration Building.\nThe Marjorie H. Stern Scholarship supports women’s rights and social justice by helping Women and Gender Studies (WGS) students in immediate financial need remain in school.\nSince 2014 when it was first established, the scholarship has supported a great number of students, and has been instrumental to their academic success.\n“Receiving the Marjorie Stern Scholarship was an honor. This scholarship helped me focus more on my studies and worry less about my medical expenses. I had a huge medical bill that I was not sure how to cover. Because of this scholarship, I was able to both pursue my studies and pay off everything I owed.”\n— Samukezi Ngubane, M.A. 2016, Recipient of Marjorie Stern Graduate Scholarship\n“I am so happy and grateful to be a recipient of this scholarship and I am confident of the positive impact it will make in not just my life, but also my family’s health and wellbeing.”\n— Clair Satuito, Undergraduate Student, 2023 Recipient of Marjorie Stern Undergraduate Scholarship\nThis Giving Tuesday consider donating to Women and Gender Studies at San Francisco State University, and make a difference in the lives of our students.\nSupport inspiring students who will make a difference in the world, like Marjorie Stern!\nDonate to the Women & Gender Studies Department\nAnnouncements\nNews\nProfessors Julietta Hua and Kasturi Ray release new book\nExploring professional passenger driving and the gig economy through feminist theories of labor\nBringing together sociologic…\nTime Bomb\nCongratulations to the talented students of WGS 690, who created this vibrant zine, showcasing the creative, political, and…\nCSU WGS Programs Call for Reinstatement of SSU WGS.

    "content": "Third-Party Billing\nThird-party sponsors are organizations, employers, agencies or departments that agree to cover student(s) tuition. Some common examples of sponsors are private and public organizations and government agencies (Department of Rehabilitation, Veteran Affairs, WIOA, etc.).\nNote: Contact the\nOffice of Student Financial Aid\nwith any questions about your financial aid.\nWho Qualifies for Third-Party Payments?\nA student needs to obtain a written letter, also known as an Authorization to Bill (ATB) Letter, from the sponsor specifying how much of the tuition they will cover and for which semester(s). Students receiving confirmation must submit this letter of authorization to\nsubsidy@sfsu.edu\nin order for the sponsor to be properly invoiced. Please retain a copy of the authorization for your records.\nNote: Contact the\nOffice of Student Financial Aid\nwith any questions about your financial aid.\nAuthorization to Bill (ATB) Letter\nThe terms of the ATB letter agreement must be defined in an official document from the sponsor. The letter should include:\nSponsor’s official letterhead\nStudent’s legal first and last name\nStudent’s SFSU ID number\nCovered semester(s), with indication if covering multiple terms\nProgram or course details covered by the agency\nAuthorized billing amount\nContact person details (name, address, phone number)\nSponsor’s signature\nThe College of Professional & Global Education does not invoice for lab or material fees. Students are responsible for these fees if the third-party contract (TPC) agency does not pay them directly.\nThird-Party Billing Process\nTo avoid being dropped from your classes, your ATB must be received at least two weeks before your class begins, which is the payment due date. This allows time to apply the service indicator to your account that protects your enrollment. This indicator will prevent you from being dropped from the covered course(s) indicated on the ATB. Application of this indicator will also postpone the payment deadline to a later date. The deferment does not mean that the University has received a payment.\nInvoices will be processed after census has passed for a given semester. The sponsor has 30 days after receipt of invoice to satisfy the balance. Refer to the\nCalendar and Deadlines\nfor important dates.\nNote:\nStudents are ultimately responsible for any outstanding charges not covered by or defaulted by the sponsor. Nonpayment will result in a hold on the student’s account which will prevent future registration.\nVeteran Benefits\nIf you are a student receiving VA benefits, contact SFSU's Veterans Services office for further assistance.\nOffice Hours\nOneStop:\nMonday to Friday 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nPhone:\nMonday to Friday 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.\nEmail:\nveterans@sfsu.edu\nTelephone:\n(415) 338-2336\nLocation:\nStudent Services Building - OneStop Window #6\n1600 Holloway Avenue\nSan Francisco, CA 94132\nFor more information, please visit the\nVeteran Services\nweb page.\nRefunds\nSee\nDrops and Refunds | Subsidy Refunds\n.\nQuestions?\nQuestions about Third-Party Billing?\nEmail\nsubsidy@sfsu.edu\nNot sure who your program administrator is?\nPlease refer to our\nProgram Directory\nfor contact information.\nDocument Readers\nare required to view documents.",

Among the festivities are college- and campus-wide research project showcases, many of which are highly anticipated long-standing traditions. All of these events shine a spotlight on the variety and caliber of student research, scholarship and creative activities (RSCA) happening at San Francisco State.\nUndergraduate and graduate students across campus shared their work in posters, presentations, performances and more. This year, the colleges of\nLiberal & Creative Arts (LCA)\n,\nScience & Engineering (CoSE)\n,\nEthnic Studies (CoES)\nand\nHealth & Social Sciences (CHSS)\nheld showcases in early May. In April, there was a\nGraduate Research and Creative Works showcase\n.\n“The purpose of the showcases is to celebrate and make visible the remarkable research and creative work that our students do. This work often goes above and beyond the traditional classroom experience and highlights the experiential learning opportunities that students have at SF State,” said Kinesiology Professor Kate Hamel, who is also assistant dean of faculty development and scholarship. “These events provide students an opportunity to develop presentation skills and network with peers, faculty and community members.”\nAt the second annual CHSS showcase, Hamel was pleasantly surprised to see that students generally stayed off their phones — which everyone knows is quite a feat — and fully engaged with the event. Students chatted and networked even as the event approached a close.\n“My research experience at SF State has been so encouraging.\nThe Marcus Fellowship\nhas allowed me to delve into topics I’m passionate about from an academic standpoint,” said LCA showcase participant Eleanor Boone, a Political Science major with a Pre-Law certificate graduating this semester. Her work examines the relationship between contemporary religious liberty decisions and sociopolitical minority rights at the Supreme Court level, and conveys the broader implication of the current court’s decisions. “It’s grown my confidence in my abilities as a student, and I hope to continue my research as I pursue higher education.”\nAt the project showcases, students shared their research and creative work to faculty, staff and external community members.\nWhile the Lam Family College of Business doesn’t have a project showcase, it held its annual\nInnovation Pitch Competition\nin April. Students pitched business projects to entrepreneurs, investors and faculty for an opportunity to compete for $10,000 in shared cash prizes and receive entrepreneurship feedback.\nIn addition to the college-level showcases, the University held its annual Student Research Competition, in which SF State students from all colleges shared their independent research. This year, 11 student delegates from the SF State competition advanced to the\n38th CSU Student Research Competition\nat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Four of the SF State participants placed second in their respective categories after competing against hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students from across the 23-school CSU system.\nVisit SF State Create to learn more about these showcases and student research opportunities\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Carnegie Hall in New York City was the venue where his solo work for the haegeum, a traditional Korean two-string fiddle, debuted on April 18.\nEunah Noh, a haegeum virtuoso from South Korea, performed Sabey’s 19-minute composition “Scattered Wings” for the first time at the\nCarnegie Hall performance\n, held in the Weill Recital Hall. It is also featured on Noh’s new album, “The World of the Haegeum.”\nSabey discovered Asian music in his early 20s, inspired by its reverence for nature. The traditional Korean style of sanjo and its use of the haegeum caught his ear. Sanjo translates to “scattered melodies” in English.\n“I love the elasticity and mutability of the silk strings of the haegeum and I am fascinated by the bow which can be tightened and loosened at will,” Sabey wrote in his program notes for “Scattered Wings.” “The instrument itself evokes the tension and release of a bird flexing and spreading its wings as it arcs elegantly in the air. The sanjo genre — which melds traditional melodies into a fluid and mobile stream, full of wide vibrato and intricate ornamentation — also strongly evokes, for me, the swoop and weave of a bird in flight.”\nAlthough Sabey does not perform the haegeum himself and it is not taught in American schools, his deftness with Western musical notation played a role in composing for the instrument. He spent hours browsing YouTube for traditional Korean performances and transcribed them by ear.\n“You learn its range, the basic mechanics of how it works, what’s possible and not possible,” said Sabey, who leads the composition, theory and electronic music programs in San Francisco State’s School of Music. “There’s not a lot of new repertoire for that instrument, so there is a lot of a collaboration with the performer. Eunah took my piece and brought her own voice to it as well.”\nSabey hopes that “Scattered Wings” encourages musicians of diverse backgrounds to collaborate and learn about each other’s cultures. He views it as “a prayer for unity in a divided world.”\n“I’ll never be able to fully appreciate the music the way a native-born Korean could appreciate it,” Sabey said. “It’s like learning a second language. You can become fluent in a second language, but if you weren’t raised in that culture, there are things about that language that you’ll never be able to fully understand.”\nAt SF State, Sabey has introduced his students to the haegeum through performer\nJeonghyeon Joo\n. She gave lectures and demonstrations and even performed new student compositions. She will return in the fall for more student-focused work as well as a performance of “Scattered Wings.”\nLearn more about the School of Music at SF State\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Photo by Juan Montes.\nJohnson visited campus to share insights from his “strategic and surprising” career with Journalism and Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts students\nEmmy-winning journalist Whit Johnson (B.A., ’04) has experienced a lot in the 20 years since he was a Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts (BECA) major at San Francisco State University. He was among the first reporters to interview Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi was killed. He reported on the recent total solar eclipse and covered two Olympics. And he just got back from Florida, where he covered Hurricane Helene.\nWhen you’ve had experiences like that, you build up a lot of stories — and Johnson returned to the San Francisco State campus Tuesday, Oct. 1, to share some. The co-anchor of the “Good Morning America” weekend editions and anchor of the Saturday edition of ABC’s “World News Tonight,” Johnson talked to students about journalism, his journey and his advice for launching a successful career. The event, held in SFSU’s Knuth Hall, was moderated by Journalism Professor Venise Wagner, who brought along students from her class “Social Impact of Journalism.”\n“I never imagined that I would end up here [as a network anchor],” Johnson said. “But the one thing that I think I did have going for me was just a work ethic that I developed while I was here at San Francisco State.”\nJohnson grew up in San Francisco, and both his parents are SF State alums. (Johnson’s dad actually joined him for his Oct. 1 visit, and they were both chuffed to talk about how the school evolved from the ’60s to the early 2000s to now.) Johnson came to the University for the broadcasting department — and soccer. He wanted to be a professional player, but injuries halted that journey.\n“While I was here, I sort of evolved from a wannabe morning disc jockey and prank caller to a sports broadcaster to a news broadcaster,” Johnson said. Since the news initially seemed intimidating, he leaned into sports broadcasting. He even voiced Gator basketball, welcoming spectators and doing PA announcements.\nRead the full article on SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

Olivia Clarke and Mayuu Kashimura’s brief prevailed over more than 200 others submitted by students from schools like Yale, Clemson and UC Berkeley.\n“I was in shock when I first found out we won,” said Kashimura, a Political Science major who expects to graduate next May. “I remember calling Olivia as soon as I found out, and we were screaming.”\n“I was ecstatic when I found out the news,” said Clarke, who’ll earn her Political Science degree this spring. “It was very surreal finding out that the brief we spent hours working on together had secured first place in the entire competition.”\nMoot courts prepare students for the rigors of arguing a legal case. The brief competitions focus on the written arguments submitted by opposing sides. Clarke and Kashimura’s brief took the side of the respondent — the individual in the case rather than the government — to argue for a hypothetical woman’s right to use birth control as part of her freedom of religion and freedom of privacy.\n“We picked this side because we felt like we were best equipped to argue a pro-respondent side,” said Clarke.\nClarke and Kashimura are members of San Francisco State’s relatively young Moot Court team. The team was created in 2017 when Nicholas Conway came to SF State as an assistant professor specializing in public law.\nRead the full story on SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "Research Addresses Issues of the World\nThe student research fellowships and assistantships are made possible through the George and Judy Marcus Funds for Excellence in the Liberal Arts\nDonate to the CLCA\nMarcus Scholars' Research Addresses Pressing Issues of the World\nFor her fellowship, History major Kayla Ratliff, pictured above, studied homosexuality in 19th-century Japan. Photo by Sreang Hok.\nby Matt Itelson\nA new donor-funded College of Liberal & Creative Arts research program provided opportunities for 15 undergraduates this year to dig deep into the world’s most debated, pressing issues: politics, race, mental health, veterans, climate change, bullying, sexuality, and more. Working closely with faculty mentors throughout the entire year, students sharpened investigative skills and creative talents and helped build an understanding of a range of issues.\n“I was struck by both the sophisticated content of your research projects and the incredible poise you all showed in presenting your topics. Congratulations on completing these under very unusual circumstances — another reflection of your talents and determination.”\n-President Lynn Mahoney to the student research fellows & assistants\nThe student research fellowships and assistantships are made possible through the George and Judy Marcus Funds for Excellence in the Liberal Arts, established by alumni George and Judy Marcus with a $25-million donation in 2018. Marcus scholars have already been successful. The Council on Undergraduate Research’s annual Posters on the Hill conference accepted International Relations major Mikayla Cordero’s project on the rise of left-wing nationalism in Ireland. Cordero was among 60 students selected from 350 applications nationwide.\n“You represent the very best of SF State,” SF State President Lynn Mahoney said at a May 26 video conference where fellows and assistants presented their work. “I was struck by both the sophisticated content of your research projects and the incredible poise you all showed in presenting your topics. Congratulations on completing these under very unusual circumstances — another reflection of your talents and determination.”\nUnderstanding student veterans\nEarly in her research on student veterans, Marcus Undergraduate Research Fellow Janelle Scarritt discovered significant inaccuracies in sociology, psychology, and anthropology publications on the topic. Interviewing student veterans at SF State enabled her to discover fresh perspectives on their capacities and challenges.\n“This experience has shown me what it takes to pursue undergraduate research and that I am capable of doing it,” Scarritt said.\nAnthropology Assistant Professor Martha Lincoln was Scarritt’s faculty mentor. She compared the one-on-one mentorship with students afforded by the program to undergraduate research experiences at small liberal arts colleges.\n“It’s just incredibly rewarding to see students pursue intellectual goals that have personal significance to them,” Lincoln said.\n“The Value of a Life”\nFor Jamila Hayes’ Marcus Undergraduate Research Fellowship, she directed “The Value of a Life,” a documentary about the divergent life paths she and her brother have taken. Hayes is thriving — she just graduated this month — but her brother has fallen victim to addiction, incarceration, and mental illness. She said the film was her first opportunity to express her feelings about her brother.\n“The reality of our world is that if you are Black you will be treated worse than your white counterparts,” said Hayes, a Cinema major. “If you are Black, homeless and a drug addict, you are treated even worse and with even less respect. As a society, we need to work harder to stop perpetuating harmful ideologies that have such a negative impact on communities of people. I hope that my film will be a part of causing that change and that it will allow people to start having these conversations.”\nAs a faculty mentor, School of Cinema Director Celine Parreñas Shimizu challenged Hayes to situate the film’s approach. In preparation, Shimizu assigned readings of scholarly articles on prison systems and aesthetics. In the end, Shimizu herself gained valuable insight from Hayes.\n“I learned about the powerful personal understanding Jamila’s courageous filmmaking achieves about enduring pain, trauma, and abuse and the hope that comes from love, affection, and intimacy,” Shimizu said.\nPresidential mathematics\nFive students served as Marcus Research Assistants, helping faculty members’ scholarly pursuits. Elizabeth Wedel, with Political Science Assistant Professor Rebecca Eissler, explored how modern U.S. presidents establish agendas. Wedel, who will enter her senior year this fall, helped research and write case studies. She focused on instances of presidents coming into conflict with Congress and the Supreme Court.\n“My research on presidential agenda setting relies quite heavily on quantitative, mathematical analysis, so my goal for our partnership was to identify and research some historical cases to illustrate the theoretical dynamics at play,” Eissler says. “She brought a curiosity and fresh perspective to the selection of cases for us to research, which gave the project a greater clarity and understandability.”\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic affected students’ ability to conduct field research this spring, they were able to complete their projects. Hayes, for example, had to abandon plans to spend one day in San Francisco filming with her brother. Instead, she interviewed him in her apartment and used footage from one of their childhood homes.\nOverall, the Marcus fellowship has given Hayes advice to pass along to next year’s cohort.\n“When things become chaotic and confusing, remember what the purpose of your proposal was about,” she said. “Sometimes it’s helpful to go back to the basics in order to better understand where to go next.”\nStudents, and faculty win Marcus-funded research awards for 2020-21\nMarcus Research Fellowship winners\n“A Price on Pride: Understanding the Commoditization of the Queer Identity in San Francisco.” Student: Maximilian DeNembo (School of Design).

French is one of the very few languages spoken all over the world, ranked the sixth most widely spoken language after Mandarin Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic.  Today, more than 220 million people speak French throughout the world: roughly 51% live in Africa and the Middle East, 40% live in Europe, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia/Oceania.  As a result of population growth there will be more than 700 million French Speakers by 2050, 80% of whom will be living in Africa. The French Program is excited to offer an an avenue to engage with this expanding and diverse Francophone cultural and linguistic world.\nWe offer full-fledged Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts programs and focus on developing proficiency in the language in a sociocultural context by offering a variety of courses and by conducting courses in culture and literature in French. Great importance is placed on participatory classes, which are small and practice-oriented, to help students adapt themselves to a changing world. Excellent computer facilities and a multimedia center provide support for our educational program.\nSF State is located in San Francisco, a cosmopolitan city with a large and active French community, which makes it a great place to study French. Students are also given a number of opportunities to study in France. Through the California State University’s international programs, selected students may study at Aix-en-Provence and in Paris. Such opportunities give students practical experience in everyday French life and culture, helping to build and reinforce these skills.\nIf you are an undergraduate student and wonder which class to take, you can take a placement test and see an advisor. Please contact an advisor for further details.\nDeclare a Major/Minor in French\nTo declare a major or minor, complete a\nDeclaration of Major/Minor form\n, then make an appointment to see the program advisor.

The International Program of the California State University has its French campus in Aix-en-Provence. This program has been very successful and offers the students a closely guided course-of-study in a university town and in one of the most pleasant regions of France. Students can also participate in an exchange program with universities in Paris (MICEFA), also coordinated by the office of International Programs on campus. The number of credits earned abroad that may be counted towards the major is 15 (towards the minor is 10), and determined though consultation with the appropriate French Program advisor at San Francisco State University.\nMasters of Art (Advancement to Candidacy)\nThe M.A. Program in French at SF State requires the completion of 30 units of course work in French Literature, culture or language, and offers two different culminating experience options: Master's Comprehensive Written and Oral Examinations, or a Master's Thesis and Master's Comprehensive Oral Examination.\nOption I\n30 units of coursework and Comprehensive Written and Oral Examinations.\nOption II\n27 units of coursework and FR 898 Master’s Thesis (3 units), plus a Master’s Comprehensive Oral Examination.\nStudents must take a minimum of 15 units of graduate courses in French.\nFor the remaining courses, they have the choice of 6 units of graduate / paired courses in French, and 9 or 6 units (according to the option) of graduate /paired / undergraduate courses in French, or related subjects. For instance, students interested in the teaching profession can take two courses in related subjects from the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures: Curriculum and Instruction I and II, e.g. 6 units of graduate course work towards the completion of their degree.\nTransfer of units and cross-registration:\nYou may transfer up to 12 units taken as an Unclassified Graduate Student at SF State, subject to approval of the graduate adviser.\nIf you cannot find courses to meet your interests or time schedule in our program, you may take up to 3 units per semester through cross-registration at other universities, in particular U.C. Berkeley, subject to approval by the graduate advisor.\nYou may transfer up to 6 post-baccalaureate units you took at another university, subject to approval by the graduate advisor in French and the graduate division of SF State, as long as these units were not counted towards another diploma.\nLevel I and Level II English requirement\nAll graduate students at SF State must complete Level I and Level II writing English requirements. The level I requirement is met when applying to the French M.A. program, by giving to the French Program a statement of purpose in English (500 words) along side the same or a similar statement written in French.\nThe level II writing requirement needs to be met while in the graduate program. It can be met in the following ways:\nOption I:\nby submitting for evaluation to the French faculty either a 15-20 page essay written in English for a graduate class (program other that the French Program), or the English translation of a 15-20 page essay written in French for a graduate class from the French Program, unless the French instructor of that class accepts to receive an essay written in English.\nOption II:\nstudents writing a thesis must write a 15-page summary of their thesis in English, if they do not choose option I. This summary will be submitted for evaluation to the French faculty.\nIn order to fulfill this requirement successfully, discuss how to be best prepared for it with the graduate advisor early in the course of your graduate studies, especially if English is not your first language or if you have deficiencies in writing.\nFor more information on the M.A. Program in French requirements and option, consult the following documents:\nCheck list for French M.A. Students (found on the\nFrench Resources page\n)\nFrench M.A advising worksheet\nGuidelines Thesis – French (found on the\nFrench Resources page\n)\nReading List – French M.A.\nThe M.A. Program in French - Course Descriptions\nHere is a sample of French M.A. courses taught in the past 3 years:\nL’Amour et la Guerre au Moyen Age\nLes Femmes du Moyen Age à la Renaissance\nLe Corps à la Renaissance\nLe Conte de Fées du 17e siècle\nLe Spectacle du Moyen Age au 17e siècle\nLe Merveilleux du Moyen Age au 17e siècle\nLe Théâtre du 17e et 18e siècle\nLes Philosophes (18e siècle)\nLes Deux Sexes du Roman (18e siècle)\nLe Roman du 19e siècle\nParis: Capitale du 19e siècle\nMonstres du 19e siècle\nThéâtre et poésie romantique\nArt et Poésie 1860-1940\nLe Roman du 20e siècle\nHumour, Arts et Littérature (20e siècle)\nLa Francophonie (20e siècle)\nExhaustive on-line French M.A. course titles and descriptions are available in the University Bulletin.\nInternational Program\nStudents can do part of the M.A. degree in France. They can participate in an exchange program with universities in Paris (MICEFA), coordinated by the office of International Programs on campus. The number of credits earned abroad that may be counted towards the M.A. is determined though consultation with the Graduate French Program advisor at San Francisco State University.\nIn addition to the aforementioned requirements, students are advised to do the following:\nSeek Graduate Advising Every Semester\nStudents should plan their courses in consultation with the graduate advisor and fill out the “Advising Worksheet - M.A. student in French” every semester. Pay attention to the type of courses and number of units needed to graduate and cross-registration regulations if you want to take courses in universities such as U.C. Berkeley or other universities from the CSU system. Send an electronic copy to your advisor to keep him/her informed of the courses taken.\nIf you are conditionally admitted to the program, seek the advisor for “Advancement to Classified Graduate Standing” when you complete the courses specified as preconditions (Such course work may NOT be used to meet degree requirement).\nBegin studying early the document containing the “Reading List” of the French M.A. Program and the description of the culminating experience requirements (option I or option II). It is a good idea to begin preparing your reading list for the oral exam early on. It is also a good idea to start reflecting on your preferences concerning the culminating experience requirements. Check also the document: “Guidelines Thesis – French”.\nFulfill the Second Level English Proficiency Requirement\nAll graduate students must complete Level I and Level II writing English requirements. The level I requirement is met when applying to the graduate program, by giving to the French Program a statement of purpose in English (500 words) along side the same statement written in French.\nThe level II writing requirement needs to be met while in the graduate program. It can be met in the following ways:\nChoice I:\nby submitting for evaluation to the French faculty either a 15-20 page essay written in English for a graduate class (pr",

    "content": "SF State alum executive produces documentary on hoops legend Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nFebruary 13, 2023\nPhoto Credit:\nCourtesy of Showtime\nSarah Allen (B.A., ’99) focuses her journalism work on social justice in sports\nTwo decades before Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the National Anthem to protest police violence, another professional athlete faced severe consequences for refusing to salute the flag. Now, a San Francisco State University alumna has brought former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf’s unique story — and the tantalizing style he played the game — to an international audience.\nLongtime journalist Sarah Allen (B.A., ’99) is an executive producer for\n“STAND,”\nthe biographical documentary about Abdul-Rauf featuring extensive interviews with him and other basketball luminaries. It premiered on Showtime on Feb. 3.\n“I fell into it because I really was intrigued by that whole conversation around athletes and activism,” Allen said. “I’m not as interested in giving somebody’s stats on the field. That’s boring to me. Athletes have stories that go beyond that.”\nBorn as Chris Jackson in 1969 in Mississippi, Abdul-Rauf exhibited a dazzling display of skills and athleticism at only 6 feet and 1 inch tall. He used his battle with Tourette syndrome as motivation. “It looked like I was watching God play basketball,” Shaquille O’Neal, a teammate of Abdul-Rauf at Louisiana State University, said in the documentary. Allen said: “Clearly, he was Steph Curry before Steph Curry.”\nAbdul-Rauf’s career was cut short, however, after he decided to sit on the bench during pregame performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” due to the continued oppression of Black people in America. He was suspended and then exiled from the league, and later his home was burned down in an act of white supremacy. Now age 54, he has enjoyed a career resurgence, dominating players much younger than him in the half-court BIG3 basketball league with the same skills he has always had.\n“Mahmoud is just very layered,” Allen said. “When you see his story, he’s had a lot of trauma in his life. When you look at him, he doesn’t seem like he’s been through everything he’s been through. And that is what intrigued me. And again, he’s a conduit for all these messages that are in the film and that I feel we should continue talking about.”\nAllen met Abdul-Rauf at the 2017 National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference, where he won an award. At the time, he was long out of the national spotlight and his story had been largely forgotten. Allen approached him and convinced him to do an interview, his first one-on-one with anyone in years. Their rapport has since evolved into Allen writing numerous stories on Abdul-Rauf and then negotiating his licensing agreement with Showtime and the contract for his 2022 memoir through Kaepernick Publishing.\nAllen’s SF State story\nAllen grew up in the Fillmore District in San Francisco. After high school at Sacred Heart Cathedral, she attended Clark Atlanta University for one year before returning to the Bay Area.\n“San Francisco State has one of the best broadcasting programs in the country, so it was a no-brainer for me,” she said.\nBy Allen’s third semester, though, she found herself on academic probation. She credits fellow Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts student Tiffany Griffith (B.A., ’99) with helping turn her academic career around.\n“She and I became fast friends and we started taking classes together. I started getting motivated to go to class, be awake during class, make sure I do my homework,” Allen said. “I think it took me about a year and a half to get off academic probation. And in a year and a half, I ended up back on the Dean’s List.\n“Once I really took it seriously, the mentors that I had there, they really made sure I succeeded,” Allen added. “And I’m just so grateful I had that experience because it really prepared me for real life.”\nLearn more about the SF State Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department.\nTags\nAlumni\nBroadcast and Electronic Arts\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "About Women and Gender Studies\nAs a department, we seek—in our research, teaching and community building—to explore both gender’s embeddedness in current forms of injustice as well as its past and emergent potential for transformative politics. Both Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts programs are offered, as well as courses for general electives and for those minoring in Women and Gender Studies.\nAlthough San Francisco State University (SFSU) has offered classes relating to women's studies since 1971, it wasn't until 1976 that the Department of Women and Gender Studies (WGS) was founded, becoming one of the first such departments in the United States. Forged out of transformative activism and scholarship, the department centers transnational and intersectional analyses of gender, race, sexuality, nation, labor and ability. Our students engage in challenging academics, work closely with professors, and lead community initiatives.\nIn developing and communicating its understanding of gender and power, the department pays particular attention to insights from critical race and postcolonial studies. Viewing the production of knowledge about gender as itself political, the department seeks --in its research, teaching and community building-- to explore both gender’s embeddedness in current forms of injustice as well as its past and emergent potential for transformative politics.\nDepartment of Women and Gender Studies Mission Statement\nStudents and faculty in the Department of Women and Gender Studies study the power relationships between gender and politics, particularly the politics of knowledge, culture, economy, medicine, science, citizenship, immigration, militarization and the body. We take up interdisciplinary and transnational methodologies to examine how gender is co-constituted with race, sexuality and nation. We explore gender’s embeddedness in current forms of inequity and oppression as well as its potential for a transformative politics. Our goal is to collectively build feminist conversations, archives and tools for social justice.\nEmail us today at\nwgsdept@sfsu.edu\nso we can answer any questions you may have!\nWGS Resource Room\nLocated in Humanities 316, this space is usually available for study and small social gatherings, Monday-Friday 9-5.

    "content": "Gray Matter Lab\nWelcome to the Gray Matter Lab\nOur mission is to enhance the quality of life for individuals with aphasia and their support networks, while also fostering the growth of future professionals through research mentorship and clinical training.\nMission & Vision Statements\nOur mission is to serve historically marginalized and underrepresented communities (e.g., BIPOC, LBGTQ+, linguistically diverse) and lead the way in developing evidence-based therapy methods for bilingual and multilingual populations with aphasia.\nOur vision is that BIPOC and linguistically diverse populations with aphasia will receive the highest quality of therapy in order to increase communicative effectiveness and quality of life experiences.\nAnti-Racist Statement\nThe Gray Matter Lab pledges our continued commitment to serve Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) and bilingual and multilingual populations that have been historically marginalized and underserved. We are committed to offering BIPOC and linguistically minoritized community members a safe space that is inclusive, respectful, and improves the quality of their lives.\nThe Gray Matter Lab stands in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. Inequalities and prejudices toward Black lives have long been systematically enshrined in the societal and legislative backbones of our nation. We denounce these inequalities and the systematic racism that Black people have long endured. The murders of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and many other black lives that have fallen victim to racism and oppression.\nWe strive to equally support and promote multiculturalism, inclusivity, opportunity, respect, and dignity for all of our members, patients, families, and others who might interact with our lab. Likewise, we recognize and aim to celebrate diversity and honor equality.\nResearch\nThe long-term goal of our research is to improve the quality of life of monolingual and bilingual people with aphasia.\nCultural Responsiveness and Equity in Aphasia Treatment\nMost of the treatment research in aphasia is based on English speaking adults from western countries. However, many people in the world speak languages other than English, and more than half the world is bilingual. Within the United States, this population is rapidly increasing, and people with aphasia who are seeking language rehabilitation services have the right to receive language treatment in their preferred language. To best serve culturally and linguistically diverse persons with aphasia, it is critical that speech and language pathologists have access to evidence-based treatment materials that are culturally and linguistically appropriate.\nAbSANT (abstract semantic associative networking training) is a naming intervention developed for English speaking persons with aphasia. In this project, we are examining the efficacy of AbSANT with Spanish speaking persons with aphasia.\nWe are currently recruiting Spanish speaking adults (monolingual or bilingual) with any type of aphasia. If interested in learning more, please contact Dr. Teresa Gray at\ngraymatterlaboratory@gmail.com\n.\nProject collaborator: Dr. Chaleece Sandberg, Penn State University\nBilingual abstract semantic associative network training (BAbSANT)\nThe purpose of this study is to determine the effects of training abstract word retrieval in bilingual people with aphasia. Previous work has found that training abstract words results in improvement to abstract words and concrete words in monolingual patients with aphasia. Outcomes regarding bilingual populations are unclear. The goal of this project is to help to guide clinical decisions for monolingual and bilingual persons with aphasia.\nWe are currently recruiting bilingual (any language combination) adults with aphasia.  Individuals can be balanced or unbalanced bilinguals with any type of aphasia.  If interested in learning more, please contact Dr. Teresa Gray at\ngraymatterlaboratory@gmail.com\nProject collaborator: Dr. Chaleece Sandberg, Penn State University\nCulturally responsive conversation groups for Black adults with aphasia\nAlthough Black people have a higher prevalence of stroke than any other racial group, they are less likely to receive speech and language services. In addition, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) are historically excluded from speech, language, and hearing sciences research. Based on our preliminary data, Black adults with aphasia have reported that participating in a Black conversation group is beneficial to their well-being because it creates a safe space where they feel more comfortable to freely express themselves, e.g., use African American English without being judged and talk about the Black experience in America. Further, the majority of aphasia treatment research is based on White people, but racial minorities comprise 40% of the population. Thus, for speech and language pathologists to best serve their diverse patient population, it is critical that we better understand treatment methods that address diversity.\nIn this study we host a Black conversation group (led by Black student clinicians) so that Black people with aphasia are in the majority, compared to the typical aphasia group where Black PWA are in the minority. We are evaluating the efficacy of this group to ascertain why and how this group is beneficial for improved communication for Black PWA.\nWe are currently recruiting Black adults with aphasia.

In this way, the lab has dedicated itself to providing all patients and students with the means they need to be successful in our lab. While we continue to seek more ways to support students and patients to create a diverse and inclusive lab space, our on-going action items that promote equity in our work include the following:\nLoan laptops and other electronics to patients who do not have access to materials necessary for remote therapy services;\nIntentionally recruit students who are bilingual, first generation, BIPOC, or who otherwise might face barriers to joining a research lab in order to ensure our lab reflects the population we serve at large (Chaudhary, 2020);\nLead informed antiracism discussions within our lab to provide a safe space for these issues to be discussed and to provide training on culturally responsive care for future clinicians (Chaudhary, 2020);\nAddress any racism or microaggressions that occur in our lab;\nWrite and submit grants that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion;\nUpdating patient onboarding documents to be more accessible and inclusive;\nUpdating diagnostic materials so that they are more inclusive of diverse populations. Regarding standardized assessments, we will adhere to publication guidelines (e.g., Boston Naming Test);\nReading scientific articles by Black researchers.\nWhile this list is not comprehensive in any way, the Gray Matter lab acknowledges that being anti-racist takes deliberate effort to root out any vestiges of systemic racism within institutions in order to stand and fight against them and so we will continue to provide an equitable space for all.\nApps/Software\nTavistock Aphasia Software Finder\nApps and software programs in English for people with aphasia.\nAphasia Apps List\nProvides a person with aphasia with information about phone applications that can help them communicate – multilingual, some apps are free\nMultilingual Therapy Materials\nCaregivers\nAphasia Recovery Connection\nMeet others with aphasia and their caregivers & families\nHelp new group friends stay in touch\nLearn the latest information about aphasia\nHelp each other through difficult times\nNational Aphasia Assocation\nOnline aphasia communities provide resources to Facebook support groups (Aphasia Recovery Connection), and blogs with stories of people with aphasia and their road to recovery (Aphasia Hope Foundation).\nMore on Aphasia\nAphasia Access\nAphasia Access: Transforming services and environments so people with aphasia can participate more fully in life.\nAphasia Institute\nThe first step in restoring confidence and improving coping skills for those affected by aphasia, showing clients and their families that it can be possible to live successfully with aphasia.\nTerapia de Habla\nBuscamos sobrevivientes de accidentes cerebrovascular MONOLINGÜES EN ESPAÑOL\nEstamos investigando como las personas con afasia aprenden palabras y mejoran la capacidad de hablar!\nTiene entre 18 y 90 años?\nPara más información, envíe un correo electronico a\ngraymatterlaboratory@gmail.com\ny pregunte por Maryvi o la Dra. Gray\nSF State: El Club de Conversación en español\nParticipe en nuestro Club de Conversación en español para adultos con afasia!\nEl Club de Conversación da la bienvenida a aquellos con afasia o un trastorno relacionado de la comunicación neurogénica.

    "title": "Supporting Students with Disabilities | Disability Programs and Resource Center",
    "content": "Supporting Students with Disabilities\nSan Francisco State University provides reasonable accommodations based on disability for eligible students. To become registered with the DPRC, students are required to meet with disability staff to discuss their disability and how it may impact their academic career. More information is explained in the frequently asked questions below. The best instructional strategy is to facilitate the accommodations that the student is authorized to use while attending SF State, which often also benefits other learners.\nPlease reach out to DPRC staff any time you have questions.\nThe following resources are also available regarding teaching and curriculum development:\nPaul K. Longmore Institute on Disability\nCenter for Equity and Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CEETL)\nWe also recommend watching our\nvideo series on the student perspective\nof disability accommodations and Universal Design for Learning, featuring our own SF State students.\nNote: For employee accommodations, please visit the\nEmployee Accommodations website\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo you have a Disability Access Statement that I can add to my course syllabus?\nYes, the DPRC has developed the following Disability Access Statement for course syllabi:\n\"Students with disabilities who need reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact the instructor. The Disability Programs and Resource Center (DPRC) is available to facilitate the reasonable accommodations process. The DPRC is located in the Student Service Building and can be reached by telephone (voice/415-338-2472, video phone/415-335-7210) or by email (\ndprc@sfsu.edu\n).\"\nIn addition to including an Access Statement on your syllabus, the following recommendations may assist in improved access and ease of accommodations to all students:\nAttendance Policy: Please include a clear policy on attendance and its role in your grading scheme, if any.  This is helpful for all students to know and understand at the beginning of the semester.\nIt is University policy to provide, on a flexible and individualized basis, reasonable accommodations to students who have disabilities that may impact how they participate in course activities or meet course requirements. Students with documented disabilities must register with the DPRC to facilitate the reasonable accommodations process. They are encouraged to contact their instructors to discuss their individual needs for accommodation; instructors are encouraged to contact the DPRC for assistance in providing accommodations.\nWe recommend the use of the\nSyllabus Tool\nsince it automatically inserts all required components and generates an accessible syllabus.\nHow will I know if a student needs an accommodation in my classroom?\nThe student will initiate a Faculty Notification Letter that will be emailed to you through our new database,\nmyDPRC\n. This email verifies the student is qualified to receive accommodations and what types of accommodations students will need. Faculty who are presented with this document by a student and have questions about the contents are encouraged to discuss them directly with the student; in the event questions remain, faculty should contact the DPRC at (415) 338-2472 for further clarification.\nFaculty are under no obligation to provide accommodations to students who do not have verification of accommodations from the DPRC office. Direct that student to the DPRC office so that a DPRC specialist and the student, together, can determine what reasonable accommodations meet the student's needs.\nMay I look at student documentation concerning disability or ask about the specific nature of a disability?\nBy law, students have the right not to share any information about the nature of their disability. As long as a student has presented you with their Faculty Notification Letter from DPRC, you are required to implement the accommodations. Faculty who have questions about the implementation of accommodations listed on this document are encouraged to talk with the student and contact DPRC if needed.\nHowever, some students may choose to share disability information with you. Be supportive and keep the information in confidence. Do not disclose the information given.  Listen, validate and refer them to DPRC.\nHow do I provide exams with accommodations?\nStudents can schedule your exams and/or quizzes to be administered with accommodations through DPRC by completing the Alternative Testing Agreement via the\nmyDPRC\nFaculty Portal. To learn more about how to complete the Alternative Testing agreement, please visit the\nmyDPRC\nfaculty training portal\nFaculty are welcome to provide exam accommodations directly if the student agrees to this and you are able to provide all accommodations listed in the Faculty Notification Letter. If you wish to directly accommodate the student, we recommend you consult with our office prior to the exam date to ensure you have a full understanding of the approved reasonable accommodation listed (Low Distraction in particular) and are able to appropriately provide them. All approved reasonable exam accommodations must be applied to the entirety of the exam if the student has requested them.\nAm I required to provide accommodations to a student that notifies me late in the term?\nYes. There could be numerous reasons why a student makes a late request. Perhaps the student could not get documentation of their disability any earlier, and therefore could not initiate accommodations earlier.  However, accommodations are not retroactive. Consult with DPRC if you have questions.\nIs there a way I or my students can convert a PDF document quickly so that it’s accessible?\nYes! Follow the instructions on the\nAccessible Media Quick Converter page\n. This service is available to all SF State Employees and Students.\nHow should I handle a disruptive student whose behavior may be related to the student’s disability?\nFaculty should understand that while they are required to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities, they are not required to tolerate behavior that is substantially disruptive to their ability to teach and to other students' ability to learn. Faculty are expected to hold all students, including those registered with the DPRC, to the same\ncode of conduct\n. Faculty are welcome to consult with the DPRC as needed. If a student's disruptive behavior cannot be contained, contact the\nUniversity Police Department\nfor immediate assistance. Faculty may also benefit from contacting the\nDean of Students\nfor additional non-emergency support.\nWhat is Universal Design for Learning?\nUniversal Design for Learning (UDL) is an educational approach with three primary principles—multiple means of representation of information, multiple means of student action and expression, and multiple means of student engagement. To learn more about campus resources related to UDL visit the\nCEETL website\nDo you have additional resources on instructional strategies for teaching students with disabilities?\nWhile National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) is geared towards science classes, the\nNSTA website\nhas resources that are helpful and applicable to most course subject areas, regardless of the type of instruction.\nWhat are some tips for supporting students on the Autism Spectrum?\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a general term for a group of complex conditions of brain development. These conditions are characterized, in varying degrees,  by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. With the May 2013 publication of the DSM-5 diagnostic manual, all autism disorders were merged into one umbrella diagnosis of ASD. Previously, they were recognized as distinct subtypes, including autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome. Each individual with autism is unique. Many of those on the autism spectrum have exceptional abilities in visual skills, music and academic skills.\nTips for Supporting Students on the Autism Spectrum\nThe following tips were generated by the students in the SF State Autism Spectrum Support Group. Taking into account the multifarious and changing abilities and needs of each individual on the autism spectrum, there is no single method or approach that will support an individual at any given time. Thus, any guidance or accommodation that we provide must be rooted in an understanding of each individual’s unique experience.\nIncrease open communication and consistency; limit unexpected changes.\nMaintain a structure that is consistent throughout the course of the semester and provide reasonable room or accommodations for incorporating any new changes to the curriculum. For example, a clear well-organized syllabus including a calendar of assignments and due dates.\nPrepare students for participation; announce topics that will be covered, expectations for the participation, providing exam review sheets or sample papers/test questions.\nIf an issue arises, address it in a courteous manner (e.g., pull the student aside; encourage the student to come to office hours or make an appointment to discuss the issue). For additional support contact the San Francisco State University Disability Programs & Resource Center at (415) 338-2472 and/or Counseling & Psychological Services Center at (415) 338-2208.\nCreate a space for diverse ways of information processing and expression.\nMake sure directions and questions are clear, direct and concise.\nPresent information through multiple methods and modalities (e.g., using illustrations, simulations, graphics, lists, models, videos, or writing in addition to verbal).\nAllow additional time for students to process directions/questions (sometimes up to 30 seconds).\nSome students may be very detail oriented and may need help seeing the bigger picture. Help students to make connections between texts, themselves, others, and the world.\nMake your expectations for communication, participation, and student conduct explicit.\nMake explicit the expected classroom behaviors with the whole class. These may include rules for mobile phone use, attendance, eating/drinking in class, or verbal participation. Work out a class arrangement to give an equal opportunity for students to contribute to class discussion.\nFacilitate equitable in-class participation. Set a reasonable time limit for students to speak. Use agreed upon signals to alert students to a need for topic or speaker change. Provide discussion prompts in advance & assign lead discussants for different questions. Offer alternatives to face-to-face discussions.\nProvide frequent and varied assessments of performance, which allow students to know how they are doing over time and to make adjustments. Diverse assessment approaches (e.g., oral presentations, case studies, take-home exams, in-class quizzes, and papers) allow different ways to demonstrate learning.\nCreate a comfortable sensory environment for learning.\nTalk with the student and find out what makes a comfortable learning environment for them and make reasonable changes to the environment– e.g., asking the class to avoid wearing scented products or bringing pungent food to class; keeping the lights dim or using natural light; and reducing noise levels.\nAdditional Resources\nTips for Faculty: How to Support Students on the Autism Spectrum (Microsoft Word Document)\nAutism Spectrum Studies at San Francisco State University\nAutistic Self Advocacy Network's\nhandbook on self-advocacy written for autistic students from autistic adults\nCenter for Equity and Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CEETL)\nfor more information on Universal Design for Learning",

In the case of pre-approved technology, the required BuyIT process has already occurred.\nServices involving an IT component, such as consulting services requiring access to the University systems and/or data, also require a BuyIT process to be completed.\nThe BuyIt process is used to (1) reduce IT costs by leveraging existing technology purchases and contracts; (2) determine whether the technology meets CSU/ campus standards (3) meet compliance requirements with CSU policies and SF State practice directives, e.g., accessibility and IT security which helps to reduce the risk of data breaches resulting in harm to CSU or individuals and any damages arising out of these breaches, and (4) ensure campus resources are available to support the chosen technology.\nThe longtime campus\nTechnology Acquisition Request (TAR)\nprocess was officially relaunched in summer 2024! We are thrilled to introduce a new streamlined interface and process under a new name: BuyIT.\nAs part of a California State University requirement, SF State technology acquisitions, whether purchased or free, must be reviewed prior to acquisition and use for operational support,\naccessibility\n, and\ninformation security\nrequirements.\nAfter an extensive assessment of the process and its requirements, including user focus group feedback sessions, the project team developed an application to support the new IT purchasing process. The new application provides a consistent and simplified experience that is intended to get even easier as we streamline application functionality.\nThis change was part of a year-long collaborative effort between Academic Technology (AT), Information Technology Services (ITS), and other campus partners, including Procurement and the Disability Programs and Resource Center (DPRC). We also benefitted from campus input through focus groups and a staff and faculty user group whose input has been critical to this process improvement initiative.\nHow does IT purchasing work?\nPhase 1: Campus IT Support Team Review\nSupport and service level models needed\nIntegrations\nIT process alignment\nIdentifying potential redundant technology\nIdentification of timing constraints, if applicable\nIf Campus IT Support does not approve the BuyIT request, the acquisition may not proceed until approval is granted.\nPhase 2: Accessible Technology Review\nIf the request does not pass the\naccessibility review\n, the acquisition will not move forward.\nVoluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT)\nA VPAT, or\nVoluntary Product Accessibility Template\n, is a self-assessment document completed by a vendor that provides relevant information on how their product or service claims to conform to Accessibility Standards.\nPhase 3: Information Security Team Review\nIndicate additional compensating controls, if needed, and determine if supplemental IT contractual terms are necessary.\nThe acquisition will not move forward if the request does not pass the security review.\nCloud Computing Acquisitions Documents\nThe vendor will be asked to provide one of the following cloud security assessment documents:\nA\ncurrent SSAE-16 SOC 2 Type II\n(or equivalent third-party audited security standard).\nA current\nCloud Security Alliance Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire\n(CSA CAIQ).\nAn industry-recognized current security certification or accreditation (e.g.,\nFedRAMP authorized\n,\nISO270xx\n, etc.).\nThe\nHigher Education Cloud Vendor Assessment Tool\n(HECVAT).\nBased upon the type of data being stored in the cloud solution, only one of the following documents identified in the table below is necessary to meet the requirement.\nType of data by classification and type of documentation\nType\nData Classification\nType of Documentation Accepted\nSoc2 Type2\nISO 270xx Certification\nFEDRAMP Authorized\nHECVAT Full\nHECTVAT Lite\nOther CSA CAIQ, or BuyIt questionnaire\nLevel 1\nx\nLevel 2 – high record count\nx\nLevel 2 – small record count\nx\nPublic\nx\nFor more information, see:\nICSUAM 8065.S003 Information Security Asset Management – Cloud Storage & Services\nRisk Acceptance Form\nA risk acceptance form is used to document non-compliance with CSU policy. The form lists any mitigating controls that are used to reduce the risk, and indicates when the risk will be remediated or next reviewed. An administrator capable of assuming the risk and the Information Security Officer must approve the risk acceptance. The Information Security team can assist with preparing the form.\nContracts\nSupplemental IT contractual terms are CSU boilerplate contractual language that addresses information security risks and can be tailored to the technology acquisition scope. The Information Security team determines if the acquisition requires any supplemental IT contractual terms to protect CSU liability. In most cases, supplemental IT contractual terms are not necessary for hardware purchases. In many cases, they are required for cloud services, software, and other IT services.\nWhen supplemental IT contractual terms are identified for an acquisition, the term numbers should be forwarded to\nProcurement and Support Services\nso they can be included and/or negotiated with the vendor.\nIf you have already submitted a requisition, forward the approved BuyIt request to Procurement and identify the supplemental IT contractual term numbers that were provided in your approved BuyIt request. If you have not submitted a requisition, include the approved BuyIT request and supplemental IT contract term numbers in the comment section when you submit your requisition.\nPhase 4: Completion and Approval\nWhen Phases 1, 2, and 3 have been completed and approved, the requesting department submits a requisition to the Procurement department with the BuyIT approval letter and\nother pertinent information\n. The letter must be submitted at the time of the Pcard reconciliation. Pcard use is only allowed for purchases under the direction of Procurement.",

    "content": "New data science certificate aims to open doors to biotech jobs\nBy\nKanaga Rajan\nWednesday, October 6, 2021\nLaunched this fall, the Data Science and Machine Learning for Biotechnology certificate was developed in collaboration with Genentech\nA new certificate program developed in collaboration with one of Silicon Valley’s biggest biotech companies will do more than teach San Francisco State University undergraduates about the interdisciplinary field known as data science. It’ll help them develop the skills they need to land jobs as data scientists.\nLaunched this fall, the\nData Science and Machine Learning for Biotechnology (gSTAR) certificate program\ngrew out of\nan already flourishing collaboration between San Francisco State and Genentech\n. Any SF State undergraduate student, regardless of major, is eligible for the certificate as long as they meet the program’s minimal prerequisites and complete six designated courses. The classes ground students in data science — an interdisciplinary field that gleans actionable insight from large volumes of data — while emphasizing professional development through rigorous mock interviews, elevator pitches and more. SF State biology and computer science faculty worked directly with Genentech scientists to develop the curriculum.\n“We used our internal computational experts who also hire computational talent to help us build this curriculum,” said Joy Branford, R&D people and culture strategic HR leader at Genentech.\nThat kind of practical, real-world input makes the program unique — and uniquely helpful — for undergraduate students hoping to jump-start biotech careers, says SF State Associate Professor\nAnagha Kulkarni\n, who is spearheading the program. Since the undergraduate population is large and diverse, Kulkarni hopes that hiring from this pool may help more women and people of color enter the biotech workforce. The problem is that biotech rarely recruits undergraduates directly after college and, prior to gSTAR, data science and professional development opportunities for undergraduates have been limited.\n“I’m hoping that this certificate opens doors and opens eyes as well on the industry side to the potential of undergraduates in the workforce,” she said.\nThe new certificate falls under the College of Science & Engineering’s larger\nPromoting Inclusivity in Computing (PINC) program\n, a computer science program tailored for biology and chemistry students like Elizabeth Mathiasen. A fourth-year physiology major, Mathiasen describes herself as a nontraditional student because she is over the age of 40 and has teenage kids.\n“Basically, it’s all geared towards preparing you for the things that we don’t usually get a lot of guidance on, and it really makes the process of planning your future a lot less daunting and a lot kinder, I think,” Mathiasen said about her current gSTAR course. After just a month of classes, Mathiasen says she’s already boosted her professional internet presence, learned how to improve her resume and gained insight into life at a biotech startup.\n“It’s been really exceptionally useful,” she said, “and it also just helps so much with the imposter syndrome.”\nThe gSTAR certificate is just one notch in SF State’s and Genentech’s goals to promote inclusivity in biotech. Kulkarni has aspirations to develop more industry partnerships to continue growing PINC and the certificate program. Long term, there are also plans to possibly open the certificate to individuals outside of SF State and establish similar programs at other educational institutions. In the meantime, Branford says the collaboration already represents a win for the entire industry.\n“I really see this as a way to pipeline that next generation of scientists,” she said.\nLearn more about the Data Science and Machine Learning for Biotechnology (gSTAR) certificate program\n.\nShare this story\nContact\nUniversity Communications\nEmail:\npubcom@sfsu.edu\nPhone:\n(415) 338-1665\nQuick Links\nNews Releases\nAnnouncements\nFaculty Experts\nCampusMemo\nSF State in the News\nSF State Facts\nCampus Directory\nUniversity Calendar\nColleges and Departments\nAthletics\nContact\nSearch",

It is a pleasure to welcome you all back. I offer a particularly warm welcome to 5500 new Gators. I know I speak for all when I say how happy we are that you have chosen SF State.\nWhether you are a new student or approaching graduation, you are on a journey that will impact your life, your family’s life and your communities. At SFSU, we take our responsibility to serve you very seriously. From Orientation to Commencement, we work hard to create the best possible opportunities for you to study and grow here. I encourage you to make the most of your\nGator experience\n–\njoin a club\n, engage with our world-class faculty, watch\nGator athletes\ncompete,\nstudy abroad\n, do an\ninternship\n, and experience all our\ncampus\nand our city have to offer. And know that all our faculty, staff and administrators are here to support you.\nSF State is, like many universities across the nation this year, grappling with a challenging and rapidly changing landscape for higher education. But our goal is to help you maximize this experience – the knowledge and skills you gain, the friends you make, and the career path you begin to chart all matter to us. A degree is a critical step to a brighter future for you and your family.\nAt last week’s Opening Convocation, I shared some thoughts on the challenges and opportunities facing SFSU and higher ed at this moment. SFSU has long been a leader in providing students access to upward mobility and we must and will remain so. I urged those in attendance to work together to confront the changing educational and economic landscapes and strengthen how we serve students and the region well. You can\nreview the full text\nfor more details on the changing landscape and ways we can navigate it successfully.\nThis does not mean we become a different university. We will lean into what makes SFSU distinct in ways that the purpose-driven students of today and tomorrow can relate to. A university that embraces its responsibility for post-collegiate outcomes. A university that transforms lives and promises upward mobility. A university where equity, innovation, and community meet.\nI know that I write this at a very uncertain time for many in the Gator community. Many of us are deeply concerned about current events – especially about federal actions which directly affect higher education and our students. Among those areas of concern is anxiety about the potential for immigration activities. We have sent out multiple messages over the past year with essential information and will again this week. Please look for these emails, and as you walk the Quad this week, grab one of the red cards located on many tables across campus. Knowing your rights and understanding university protocols will help us navigate this painfully uncertain time. And also know that there is a wealth of resources available to you at SF State. The\nDean on Call\nprogram is a great starting point for those looking for support.\nWe are a university famous for its inclusivity, its compassion, and its commitment to educational equity. As you walk across campus, you will see banners celebrating the SFSU experience. The one that always catches my eye is “SFSU: We see the world in a more positive light.” I see this reflected in our commitment to changing the world—a reflection of our very high standards for inclusion and for equity. As we embark on another academic year, even amidst much uncertainty, let’s embrace these values and continue to show one another the compassion and support that makes us a special place.\nWonderful to see you all back on campus! Please be sure to stop and say hi when you see me on campus! Wishing all a great semester!\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nPresident's Messages - 2025\nWelcome to Fall 25 (Faculty and Staff)\nAugust 25, 2025\nDear colleagues,\nWelcome to the fall 2025 semester! This semester, we welcome 5500 new students, and our campus is now once again buzzing with the energy of more than 21,000 students. I welcome all with great excitement as we begin the new academic year!\nI start with thanks. Last year was a challenging one in so many ways, but we worked together and start the year strong. Together, we advocated passionately for the value of the CSU and SFSU and were spared a catastrophic eight percent state cut. We prioritized compassion and supported one another as we navigated threats to members of our community due to rapidly shifting federal policies. And we worked even harder to reduce costs in alignment with our revenues. Just a few years ago, we had a staggering $36 million structural deficit in our budget. This year we are projecting a $7 million deficit. While any deficit is a cause for concern, our progress toward financial stability is impressive.\nI cannot begin to express how grateful I am to each and every member of the Gator Family. I want to thank, in particular, members of the\nUniversity Budget Committee\n(UBC), the Institutional Review Committee (IRC), the Athletics Review Committee, college and departmental leaders, our vice presidents, and all faculty, staff and administrators who have worked – and are working – hard to make really difficult decisions and prioritize our students. My thanks to everyone involved in this work.\nOur challenges are far from over as uncertainty about the state budget and federal actions loom. While we avoided a dire eight percent state reduction, we did receive a three percent reduction in our recurring state funds. The budget language is confusing and includes the offer of a one-year loan in hopes that the state allocation will be restored in future budget years. One-time monies, as I have noted before, are not funds the CSU can allocate to recurring costs. The Chancellor’s Office is currently discussing this with the state to gain more clarity. Additionally, we must continue to reduce costs to close our own remaining budget deficit as well as to prepare for an anticipated reduction in our CSU allocation next year totaling as much as $18.5 million. The work of the UBC and the IRC remain critical and I look forward to working together to implement recommendations. I encourage all to attend UBC meetings or review the materials on the committee’s website.\nAt last week’s Convocation, I shared some thoughts on the challenges and opportunities facing SFSU and higher ed at this moment. SFSU has long been a leader in providing students access to upward mobility and we must remain so. I urged those in attendance to work together to confront changing educational and economic landscapes and rethink what we do to continue to serve students and the region well. You can\nreview the full text\nfor more details on the changing landscape and ways we can navigate it successfully.\nWe continue to make enrollment a top priority—both by identifying new potential student audiences for SF State and by strengthening our commitment to retaining the students we already serve. We have some opportunities to stabilize and maybe even grow enrollment a bit—but only if we work together in new ways to attract and retain students.\nThriving in the current enrollment landscape requires that we better articulate or even reimagine ourselves as a launchpad for the AI-powered workforce that takes advantage of our location in San Francisco, the city now identified as the capital of the AI revolution, and by growing our industry partnerships and hands-on learning for students in every major. We must clearly demonstrate how an SF State degree addresses the key concerns of students from affordability to purpose-driven innovative educational experiences to rewarding careers.\nI am not suggesting we become a different university. We can lean into what makes SFSU distinct in ways that the purpose-driven young people of today and tomorrow can relate to—a university that embraces its responsibility for post-collegiate outcomes. A university that transforms lives and promises upward mobility. A university where equity, innovation, and community meet.\nAnd we will do this together. I encourage every single member of the Gator Family to embrace their role as an ambassador for the University, knowing that the work each of you does contributes to student retention and success, and we need you to tell our story loudly and proudly.\nI know, though, that I write this at a very uncertain time for many in the Gator community. Many of us are deeply concerned about current events – especially about federal actions which directly affect higher education and our students. Among those areas of concern is anxiety about the potential for immigration activities. We have sent out multiple messages over the past year with essential information and will again this week. Please look for these emails, and as you walk the Quad this week, grab one of the red cards located on many tables across campus. Knowing your rights and understanding university protocols will help our students navigate this painfully uncertain time. As we start the semester with much uncertainty, I encourage all to show compassion for one another and continue the support we always show to all members of the Gator family.\nI conclude as I always do—with deep appreciation for all you do. Wishing all a great semester!\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nJuly 2025 State Budget Update\nJuly 11, 2025\nDear campus community,\nAs many of you likely know, the final state budget has been approved and signed by Governor Newsom. You can\nread the CSU’s special message to employees here\n.  While any cut in CSU funding is never good news, especially as mandatory costs continue to increase, we are relieved that the deeper, proposed 7.95% cut to the system’s budget did not come to pass. We are grateful to our many advocates in state government and supporters across the state who recognize the value of the CSU to our economy, students, alumni and communities.\nSome may find this year’s budget particularly confusing. While clearly reducing base funding to the CSU, the state budget offers the CSU a short-term loan of $144 million to cover the funding for one year in hopes that the state’s budget in future years will allow for the restoration of the base funding reduction. One-time funding, particularly during a period of state and federal economic uncertainty, requires careful review. The Chancellor’s Office is reviewing the loan offer and other implications to the CSU budget. The state budget also includes one-time funding for Sonoma State to assist with their work of reorganizing in the face of the changing higher education landscape. A detailed report will be presented at\nthe next Board of Trustee’s meeting, July 21-23\n.\nThanks to the smaller than initially planned reduction in state funding and to our continued efforts to align our expenses with our enrollments, we start the year well-prepared. I am grateful for the work of the University Budget Committee (UBC) and all those who have worked hard to reduce costs while prioritizing students. With careful planning, we have reduced our deficit and have the economic uncertainty funds to address the remaining 2025-26 deficit. As always, details will be shared at the UBC when\nits meetings\nresume on August 28, 2025.\nThe CSU’s budget challenges continue. The CSU simply does not receive adequate funding for the number of students we serve. But thanks to the hard work of many, we have avoided the worst. I offer my deepest thanks to all who advocated so effectively on behalf of the CSU and to the SFSU family for all you do on behalf of our students and University.\nWishing all a good summer.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nCelebrating the Class of 2025\nJune 3, 2025\nDear campus community,\nI write today in celebration of the more than 7,000 students who graduated from SF State this year and to congratulate you all for the many accomplishments achieved this academic year. It was not the easiest of years as SFSU, and higher education in general faced threats on many fronts. I have urged us to remain to committed to our mission and do the work even while challenges abound. And there are so many signs that we are succeeding, from the number of graduates in the Class of 2025 to the successful advocacy that to date has the CSU avoiding catastrophic cuts. We have done this together, and I remain as always deeply grateful to all for the work they do to make SFSU special.\nThe\n2025 Commencement\nwas, as always, a joyous celebration. Thousands of students received their degrees, cheered on by their SF State family and 30,000 loved ones. As has been my tradition, I share a sampling of our graduates’ successes and words with you.\nWe celebrated students like Chevon Jordan who is headed to John Hopkins University to begin her doctoral studies in Biochemistry, and Stephanie Uzordinma Awuzie who completed a master’s in Cell & Molecular Biology and served as President of the Black Excellence in STEM club.\nWe celebrated students who distinguished themselves in Moot Court competitions like Mayuu Kashimura and Chloe Henning. And we celebrated students who succeeded on a very different court--the volleyball court! Congratulations to the SFSU Women’s Volleyball team, led by team captain Kimberly DeBoer, on their historic season as runners up in the NCAA Division II National Championship.\nWe celebrated students for their commitments to SFSU values of inclusion and social justice like Grace Thwin, a first-generation college student who devoted countless hours to supporting immigrant communities, and Nysen Maride, who completed an internship with the Service Employees International Union focused on immigration rights and also volunteers with the Bay Area Lesbian archives.\nWe celebrated the\n12 hood recipients\nselected by their colleges. These students succeeded academically and made significant contributions to their disciplines, to their communities, and to SF State. And we celebrated the legacy of Dawn Bohulano Mabalon, a pioneering historian of Filipino American studies and member the SF State family, whose impact on our students, our campus, and our community was transformative.\nThis year’s speakers were deeply inspiring, particularly in the context of today’s challenges. Associated Students President Bradon Foley, inspired by Martin Luther King, challenged graduates to be the light that drives out darkness, to be love that drives out hate. Cal State Student Association President Iese Esera, graduating with a master’s in Public Administration, reminded his fellow graduates that “Our climate is worth saving. Our democracy is worth protecting. Social justice is worth pursuing. Our stories are worth telling. Our pain is worth healing. Public higher education is worth investing in. Our future…is worth fighting for. “\nKeynote speaker California Attorney General Rob Bonta acknowledged the breadth of the crises facing the U.S. and higher education and encouraged graduates to ask themselves “what role can you play?” He urged the Class of 2025 “to do something—something that makes our shared society fairer and stronger. Something that helps fix a broken part of the world. Something that heals pain.”\nAs I looked out upon the thousands of graduates and their loved ones, I felt deeply reassured that no graduates are better prepared to meet these times than SF State graduates. The Class of 2025, and all our students, are beacons of hope and catalysts of change. Thank you and congratulations.\nWishing all a good summer!\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nUpdate on San Francisco Bay Region Network\nMay 7, 2025\nDear Campus Community,\nAs I shared with you in March, I will present at the May meeting of the CSU Board of Trustees along with Cal State East Bay President Cathy Sandeen and Sonoma State Interim President Emily Cutrer a plan outlining the next steps in creating the San Francisco Bay Region Network. This Network will create a single infrastructure for transactional activities and services typically located in Administration and Finance. It represents a creative and innovative collective response to the current landscape where urgent budget conditions and persistent demographic declines similarly and negatively impact the three campuses. It is important to remember that the three remain individually accredited, distinct and unique universities.\nOutlined in the\nBoard Item (Committee on Finance, Discussion Item 7\n) is the rationale for the creation a single effective and cost-efficient organization for some transactional activities within four functional operations (Human Resources, Procurement, Financial Aid, and IT) to be completed by January 2026.  It names SF State’s VP for Administration and Finance Jeff Wilson to serve as project lead.  He will convene appropriate groups of campus experts and a communications team to begin work this summer. The communications team in addition to regular email will also develop a website to ensure stakeholders at all three campuses will have synchronous access to information. Our goal is to ensure, just as we have with this email, that information is shared consistently across all three universities.\nWe expect the creation of the Network to achieve significant administrative cost savings and preserve services that would otherwise be damaged by budget cuts and associated cost-savings measures.  Each president will ensure strict compliance with all existing policies, regulations and collective bargaining agreements. Design and implementation decisions will be made in consultation with campus experts and stakeholders with the explicit goal of developing uniform practices across all three universities based on data and national best practices.\nSeparately, and prior to the creation of the Network, the CSU launched the Multi-University Collaboration Initiative. This broader systemwide effort aims to reduce or avoid costs, streamline and simplify processes, enhance the quality and efficiency of customer. The Initiative is currently focused on benefits administration, information security, and procurement. SF State is represented on the Initiative by Michael Scott, Interim Vice Provost for Academic Resources\n,\nand\nJesús Garcia, Executive Director for Administration.\nWhile the Network and the Initiative are distinct efforts, they are also interrelated. For example, the Initiative’s work on CSU Buy, the systemwide procurement system, will serve as a foundation for the Network’s efforts to integrate procurement functions across the three campuses.\nThe San Francisco Bay Region University Network is a bold, creative, proactive and necessary strategy to address the economic and demographic realities we face. Importantly, the aim of the Network is to ensure Cal State East Bay, San Francisco State and Sonoma State maintain their distinct characteristics and strengths, accreditation standards, and service to their surrounding communities.   The Network has great promise to serve as a collaborative model – for other regional networks within the CSU, as well as for challenged regional public universities throughout the nation.\nThanks for your patience and support as we work through the process.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nAn Exhilarating Time of the Year\nApril 24, 2025\nDear campus community,\nThis time of the year is both overwhelming and exhilarating. Students and faculty are preparing for final exams and projects. Staff and administrators are planning for myriad spring events and making our grounds beautiful as we all prepare to welcome visitors to campus for end-of-year celebrations, graduation photos and ultimately Commencement on May 23.\nI encourage you all to attend some of the incredible things happening on campus this time of year.  This past week, I enjoyed speaking with colleagues and students at the\nClimate HQ’s\nClimate and Environmental Justice Jobs Mixer in the Quad.

    "content": "SF State graduate founded America’s longest-running Juneteenth celebration\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nJune 12, 2024\nPhoto Credit:\nFrom left: Wesley Johnson, an unidentified woman and blues musician T-Bone Walker in the Texas Playhouse nightclub. Courtesy of the Wesley Johnson Jr. Collection.\nWesley Johnson was a 1930s student activist before becoming a seminal entrepreneur in San Francisco’s Fillmore District\nFor the second time ever, the San Francisco State University campus will close on June 19 for Juneteenth. The festivities in San Francisco for the new federal holiday — which commemorates the emancipation of African American enslaved persons — have been rededicated to their founder, a San Francisco State alumnus named Wesley Johnson.\nIn 1945, Johnson created what would become the longest continuously running Juneteenth celebration in America. The native Texan announced it in grandiose fashion, riding a white stallion in the street and inviting passersby to celebrate at his Fillmore District nightclub. Nineteen years later, he established the Juneteenth parade in San Francisco, leading the way again on a white horse in his signature 10-gallon white Stetson cowboy hat to set off a three-day festival. This year the parade took place on June 8, alongside a month filled with festivals in several neighborhoods.\nSF State alumna Melina Jones, who has served on the committee for the Juneteenth parade and festival, learned about Johnson when researching the history of the holiday for her annual “BlaCOEUR” Juneteenth event.\n“I just got so excited about him and his legacy in the Fillmore during the Harlem of the West era of the ’40s and ’50s,” said Jones, a designer and rap artist born and raised in San Francisco. “I was incredibly proud just to be from here and to know that I get to be from a region where there are all of these innovators who are just brilliant cultural engineers.”\nWesley Johnson was born in 1908 in Galveston, Texas — the same city where Juneteenth celebrations began on June 19, 1866, one year after a Union Army general issued an order informing Texans that enslaved persons were now free. Although President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, it took two and a half years for the news to spread and for abolition to be enforced.\nAfter World War I, when Johnson was still a teenager, he and his family moved to San Francisco. Due to racist housing covenants and redlining, African Americans were welcome to live in only three of the city’s neighborhoods; the Johnson family settled in the Fillmore District. He entered San Francisco State College when the campus was located on Haight Street with about 1,100 students, very few of them Black.\nSeveral archival news clippings from the Golden Gater student newspaper, available in the University Archives in the J. Paul Leonard Library, highlight Johnson’s engagement in student life. In fall 1931, pledges from the Delta Sigma Theta sorority threw him a party to celebrate the birth of his second son. “Oh yes, all I need now is three more and I will have a basketball team!” Johnson quipped.\nAs president of the International Relations Club, Johnson directed “The Big Broadcast,” a live variety show on campus in the 1930s. Tickets were 20 cents each. “Do you want to witness the greatest show ever given at State?” Johnson said in the Golden Gater to promote the show.\nSF State Associate Librarian Meredith Eliassen, the University’s archivist, notes that Johnson launched one of the first student organizations for African Americans. In 1935 he created the Utopian Club for African Americans to discuss social issues. The following year it became the Negro Students Club, which would eventually be replaced by the first-ever\nBlack Student Union\n.\nEliassen says Johnson paved the way for students who decades later organized efforts to effect change, particularly the strike of 1968 – 1969 that resulted in the nation’s first\nCollege of Ethnic Studies\n.\n“The issues for Black students in the ’30s were the same as the ’60s: They were paying a fee, but not getting an equal education,” Eliassen said, noting students were unhappy about exclusionary admissions policies and curricula that omitted persons of color.\nAfter graduating from SF State, Johnson became one of the seminal entrepreneurs in the Fillmore District, as detailed in a\nWestern Historical Quarterly\narticle by Emily Blanck from 2019. The commercial corridor of Fillmore Street was thriving with African American-owned businesses, giving the area its status as the “Harlem of the West.” Among the area’s 20 nightclubs were Johnson’s Texas Playhouse (also known as Club Flamingo, with 15 hotel rooms above the ground floor) and the Congo. On any given night Johnson would be spinning jazz music and dancing “up and down the bar,” waitress Dorothy Alley said in the 2006 book “Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era” by Elizabeth Pepin (B.A., ’94) and Lewis Watts. Famous musicians like Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong would visit and spend time with Johnson.\nJohnson retired as grand marshal of the Juneteenth parade in the late 1980s. His legacy continues to grow, as people like Jones seek to share his story and his values with younger generations, with the aim to inspire as many as possible. She designed a new website and logo for Juneteenth in San Francisco. Unveiled just last month, the logo depicts a silhouette of Johnson on a white horse. Jones also wrote\nan article about Johnson for the Juneteenth San Francisco website\n.\n“When he had these businesses, he looked incredibly impeccable. Everybody came with this allure and this air of excellence and pride — and he would not have it any other way,” Jones said. “You could see that he had this very unwavering desire to be excellent, and you could see it in all the pictures. I think he was extremely strategic and just very proud.”\nVisit the University Archives in the J.

    "content": "Michael Bien Establishes Scholarship Fund for Project Rebound students in memory of his late wife Jane E. Kahn\nAuthor:\nUniversity Development\nApril 19, 2024\nMichael Bien and the late Jane E. Kahn\nJane E. Kahn (1954-2018) was an illustrious civil rights lawyer who fought tirelessly to improve the rights and well-being of incarcerated people in California and beyond. She often partnered with her husband and fellow attorney Michael Bien, whom she met in her first year as an undergraduate at Brandeis University. Together, they diligently advocated for the protection of the basic and constitutional rights of incarcerated people, resulting in major reforms to the California penal system. Jane’s wins included a landmark 2011 Supreme Court ruling requiring a significant reduction of the overcrowded California prison population to allow systemwide improvements in mental and health care.\nCivil rights attorney Jane E. Kahn (1954-2018)\nAfter a struggle with cancer, Jane passed away at the end of 2018 at the age of 64. Michael continues the couple’s trailblazing work through class action lawsuits that are designed to protect the disenfranchised and make our society more equitable. “Jane had always been interested in law as a vehicle for social change and for improving society,” says Michael. “She cared a lot about improving the lives of incarcerated people and formerly incarcerated people and worked to make sure that they had reentry opportunities and a fair shot. She was a real believer in education as a tool for people to transition back to society and to have the tools to succeed when they come out of prison.” Jane served on the Board of the Prison University Project at San Quentin—now renamed Mount Tamalpais College—and Michael has continued to support the College with gifts in Jane’s memory.\nJane and Michael were dedicated donors to San Francisco State University’s Project Rebound program before she died. Project Rebound is one of the first in the country to provide currently and formerly incarcerated people with alternatives to the revolving door of the criminal justice system. Working inside prisons and on campus, it provides tools and resources to scaffold incarcerated and formerly incarcerated students in pursuing college and graduate degrees. It is very successful, with high graduation rates and low recidivism amongst its students and alumni.\nIn 2023, Michael deepened his commitment to Project Rebound and made a generous gift to provide scholarships for Project Rebound students by establishing the Jane Kahn Endowed Memorial Fund. The fund will further Jane’s legacy by providing formerly incarcerated graduate school students—who are often less eligible for grants and loans than undergraduates—with scholarships.\n“Jane believed that we need to allow people to bring their best self forward, to give them an opportunity to rejoin society in a meaningful way,” says Michael. “Project Rebound connects to individual human beings in a way that makes a difference in their lives. In a broader sense, it helps defeat the myth that people who have been found guilty of doing something bad at one point in their lives should be ‘thrown away.’ People can change, and we have to give them the tools to do that, and to rejoin and be contributing members of society.”\nAfter decades of advocating for systemic change, supporting Project Rebound has a poignancy for Michael. He hopes that his gift will inspire others to give to the program as well. “By supporting these students, we’re showing them that society has not given up on them,” says Michael. “And then they become great messengers in turn to their peers and to people that they can reach, that there is a path forward, you're important people in society and people believe in you.”\n“I hope that others who have the means to give will see this program as deserving of their support. That they will join us in supporting Project Rebound because I know the need is much greater than what we can address with this one gift.”\nFOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT DONATING TO PROJECT REBOUND:\nContact Anjali Billa, Associate Vice President of University Development, at\nanjalibilla@sfsu.edu\nTags\nProject Rebound\nscholarship\nCivil Rights\nRelated News\nSFSU School of Design Students Take Climate Innovation to Global Stage\nSeptember 30, 2025\nAngela Tafur, First Kirkeberg Scholar, Leads with Purpose\nSeptember 30, 2025\nKenneth S.

The college offers academic units, continuing education units, online classes and noncredit courses.

I was welcomed warmly with open arms from the Center for Global Engagement staff and wider network and never looked back…”\nEmma Creighton\nStudent from New Zealand\nInternational Business\n\"I moved from Argentina to San Francisco in 1998. Since I have always worked in the legal field I decided to apply my experience here in the U.S.\nMy knowledge of American law was very limited, and I did not want to go to law school. I researched and found the Paralegal Studies program at San Francisco State University and discovered that it had everything that I was looking for at a reasonable price.\nThe classes were excellent and the teachers were very knowledgeable. My English was not very good at the beginning of the program, so in addition to my work and classes, I spent several hours every week doing my homework and preparing presentations.\nIt took me a year and a half to complete the program, and on the same day that I graduated I was offered a paralegal position at Baker & McKenzie, where I worked from 2000 to 2007.\nIn 2007 I came to Google, where I'm still working as an international corporate paralegal applying everything I learned in the Paralegal Studies program at San Francisco State University. I have always wanted to work in international law, so the fact that I can speak a second language (in my case Spanish) helped me to market myself and find a job in that field.\nOne of the most valuable things that I am still enjoying from the Program is the friendship that I developed with several of my classmates. We get together every couple of months to catch up with our lives and to exchange experiences in our respective offices. Also, it's a great networking tool that has helped several of us to find jobs.\"\nMariano Curat\nGraduate\nParalegal Studies\nCenter for Global Engagement\nThe Center for Global Engagement provides international students and professional groups unparalleled access to pursue rigorous academic education, cutting-edge professional development and enriching cultural exploration at an American university.

Deadline is Oct. 31.\nMission Statement\nThe Experimental College at San Francisco State University is committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable educational environment where freedom in teaching and learning is paramount. We inspire students and educators to embrace diverse and flexible teaching methods, fostering creativity, experimentation, and critical pedagogy in a supportive environment free from traditional methodologies and censorship.\nWe prioritize creating networks between EXCO participants and respected subject-matter experts in the community. By fostering these partnerships, we enable students and educators to undertake endeavors not traditionally possible within conventional academic structures.\nWe hope that the ideas and concepts developed here will be extended into the broader curriculum. As a college within the college, EXCO acts as a model for the university to integrate these innovative approaches into mainstream academic programs. We strive to push the boundaries of education, nurturing dynamic, inclusive, and relevant curricula that is responsive to the needs of our community.\nOur Goals\nPrimarily, we exist to serve students (or else nothing else matters). We exist to serve the needs of SF State students, this means EXCO is whatever students want it to be, and whatever they make it.\nFirst of all, we must offer student-taught classes; this means we need to recruit and train student teachers for future semesters, according to common pedagogical and progressive education practices.\nWe also need to maintain administrative (and general) approval and support. Generally, we should try to make friends on campus and not enemies…as much as possible.\nWe also ought to affect some lasting change or changes on campus.\nThe experiment of the original experimental college was that students could run a better and more useful school than the administrators could; obviously, this has subjective meaning having to do with the goals of the institution, and one’s idea or goal of education. The original EXCO existed as a College within a College, with the goal of affecting change in the bigger College. EXCO existed to fill a gap in the traditional system.\nWe believe that the institution is here to educate students. Meaning help them progress through curriculum that they want to learn, at their own pace, for their own benefit. Progressive education practices are proven to help accomplish this: students learn faster and retain more when they have hands on experience. When they play an active role in decision-making they are more interested in the material. EXCO teaches students the skills that empower them to learn for themselves long after they leave SF State, and remember what they learned while they were here.\nBy modeling progressive education, we hope to influence the bigger University to adopt our principles. In this way we are also contributing to the progressive education movement.\nTAKE A STUDENT-LED COURSE\nSee a list of our current or upcoming courses\nTEACH AN EXCO COURSE\nComplete our teacher application to teach your own course.",

    "content": "President's Messages - 2023\nA Personal Note of Thanks to the Gator Family\nDecember 18, 2023\nDear campus community,\nWith the fall semester concluded and the holiday season in full swing, it has been my custom to send a holiday message. Typically, I send a message highlighting our accomplishments, sometimes those of individual members of the University community, other times institutional gains. This year I am taking a different tack and sending a message of personal gratitude.\nThe fall semester was a difficult one for many and for myriad reasons. Amidst the tension and pain, I experienced many kindnesses from the Gator family – kindnesses that demonstrated the remarkable community we are, even at the hardest of times. As I endured an unexpectedly long and painful recovery from foot surgery, I was sustained by the kind wishes I received from so many students, faculty, staff and administrators. I enjoyed a gift of jam made by a faculty colleague and home-grown lemons gifted by another. I appreciated text and email messages from Associated Students leaders and many colleagues. I was grateful for the gifts of scones, dinner, children’s drawings, and plants and the many cards I received. I am particularly grateful to the three Gators who helped me at a shoe store in the Sunset and my SF State-trained physical therapist who have ultimately helped me get back on my feet.\nI am experiencing – personally – the care that the SF State community provides to so many. Your kindnesses remind us of all of who we are and what we can be despite our moments of tension and difference. As 2023 winds to a close, please know how deeply I appreciative all of you.\nWishing you happy holidays and a happy and healthy 2024.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nWhat Makes SF State Special\nNovember 20, 2023\nDear campus community,\nI am sadly aware that far too often I write to share bad news. While acutely mindful of ongoing challenges at the CSU and at SF State and the pain generated by national and international tragedies, I write today in a spirit of celebration to remind us of all the incredible things happening every day at SF State.\nA year or so ago, the CSU Board of Trustees asked each CSU campus to prepare a video highlighting what makes their campus special. The focus of our video was immediately clear—our incredible students. Our students take advantage of the best we offer—inclusivity, innovation, hands on learning—to create educational experiences that we alone can provide. SF State faculty, staff, and administrators create an incredible canvas upon which our students craft their experiences. I share today\nthe video\nwhich was shown at the November Board meeting—a testament to the value of what we do despite, or maybe in spite of, the always present challenges.\nI have mentioned before that U.S. News and World Report rated us #8 in the nation for the upward mobility of our graduates. Behind that rating are thousands and thousands of successful alumni, among them George and Judy Marcus. Last week’s Marcus Research Showcase provided us an opportunity to celebrate our accomplished alumni and the faculty research and creative activities they have generously supported. Governor Gavin Newsom shared his thanks with the Marcuses via video and touted the unique contributions that SF State makes to the region.\nFrom humble origins, the Marcuses have become leading philanthropists locally, nationally, and internationally. In 2018 they made a transformative gift to SF State of $25 million. These funds are supporting, among other things, faculty and student research in the College of Creative and Liberal Arts. Like our students, SF State faculty take advantage of our unique space to create and innovate. At the Marcus Research Showcase, faculty from disciplines across the college shared their boundary-breaking work in cinema, dance history, journalism, history, humanities, and liberal studies—work that many said could only be done here at SF State.\nWhile this moment may be difficult, at SF State we are also surrounded by the great joy of watching our students succeed and by distinguished colleagues. The commitment our faculty, staff, and administrators show to our mission and our students distinguishes us and is reflected in our national standings for upward mobility.\nIn that spirit, I express as always, my deep gratitude to you all and my wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nCSU Labor Negotiation Update\nNovember 8, 2023\nDear Campus Community:\nLast week, I had an opportunity to enjoy a conversation with students at the Black Unity Center. The students I met with were smart, engaged, enthusiastic about SF State, and assertive about their desire to make sure that we offer them the best educational experience. The first question I was asked centered on the possibility of a faculty strike. I answered as I always do by affirming my support for the labor rights of faculty and all employees and by assuring students that we will work to prioritize their academic progress despite any disruptions that may come, just as we did in March 2020 when we turned this campus upside down almost overnight.\nI share today, that, while the CSU has successfully settled contract negotiations with several unions, it remains at impasse with two unions, the Teamsters Local 2010, who represent the Skilled Trades, and the California Faculty Association. While I remain hopeful that the CSU and these unions will reach a successful conclusion, I write today to let all know that we may experience labor disruptions this month and to assure you that we will continue to keep student success and campus safety as our primary goals.\nWe learned this week that the Teamsters have announced plans for a potential strike as early as next week. I assure you that should a Teamsters strike take place, our university will remain open to students, faculty, staff and the public. Classes and events will continue as scheduled. Employees will receive further details from Human Resources. Campus Safety and University Police will be serving the campus to ensure a safe environment for all.\nI know that news of any disruption is jarring in the midst of a very hard semester for many. Students are concerned about affordability and their academic progress. Our colleagues are concerned about fair compensation and the consequences of decreased enrollment. Beyond our campus, the U.S. remains politically polarized, evidence of climate change abounds, and the world is plagued by wars and tragedy. I can offer little in the way of solutions. But I can say that in my four-and-a-half years here, I have seen us rally time and time again to support one another. We will continue to do so, even in the face of campus disruptions. Please know that the safety of our community and the academic progress of our students remain my top priorities. We will weather this as we have so many other things.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nCSU Commitment to its Employees and Students\nSeptember 21, 2023\nDear colleagues,\nLast week’s CSU Board of Trustees meeting was a challenging one. The Board discussed, and ultimately approved, a tuition increase. With only two sources of revenue available to the CSU (state funding and tuition), the Board, while expressing regret, voted to increase tuition based on a clear need for additional revenues. Studies have demonstrated a\nfunding deficit for the CSU\nand\nthe critical need to better compensate\nCSU faculty and staff. Investing in our employees is an investment in our students and their future.\nWe have an equally strong responsibility to our students to make sure cost does not impede their access or progress. A third of the additional tuition raised will be channeled back into financial aid as State University Grants (SUG). Undergraduate tuition will increase $342 next year, and graduate tuition will increase by $402. This will generate approximately $9M in extra tuition for SF State—$3M of which will automatically be allocated to SUG and will provide more SF State students with more financial aid.\nAs the student stories shared with the Board of Trustees attest, the total cost of attendance—especially housing—can make a degree prohibitively expensive. This is an area in which we must do better by increasing available aid and making it easier to access it. Last year, we allocated $300,000 to grants designed to help students with unpaid balances stay at SF State, augmenting the existing HOPE Crisis grant program. Our successful advocacy for a state-supported residence hall will reduce the cost of on-campus housing by 25% for low-income students. And, just last week, the SF State Foundation Board discussed plans to focus their philanthropic efforts on funding that reduces the total cost for students. All know that students are struggling with the total cost of attendance. While there are no quick or easy fixes, this a key priority for the University.\n“…the future of California depends on our students and graduates.”\nAs you work with students, particularly those with concerns about being able to pay the additional amount next academic year, please encourage those facing financial challenges to contact\nFinancial Aid\n. Students experiencing sudden or acute need should contact\nthe Dean on Call\n, apply to\nthe HOPE Crisis Fund\n, or reach out to the\nBasic Needs\nteam. There are resources available to assist students. Please encourage them to ask for assistance.\nI assure you that the remaining $6M raised for SF State by the tuition increase will directly support employee compensation. At SF State, 91% of our base operating budget (a combination of state support and tuition) directly supports wages and benefits for employees, 90% of whom are faculty and staff. I remain deeply committed to supporting fair and adequate compensation for SF State employees.\nThe discussion at the Board last week affirmed what we all know—state funding for the CSU has lagged behind our need. I am grateful to be in a state in which the Governor and legislature have made a compact with public higher education to provide additional funding despite a serious state budget shortfall. But it is simply not enough.\nI conclude by paraphrasing CSU Trustee and SF State alumnus Jose Antonio Vargas who implored the state to look at the funding inequities in California’s higher education system and demanded that the state do better for the CSU. We must continue to work together to advocate for adequate funding for the transformative education that we provide students. As Trustee Vargas noted, the future of California depends on our students and graduates.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nWelcome to Fall 2023\nAugust 21, 2023\nDear campus community,\nWelcome to Fall 2023! It has been wonderful the last week or two to catch up with colleagues and students as fall activities began. Many of you have shared stories of long-delayed family reunions and travel, of camping trips and summer concerts, and progress on projects and work. I hope all achieved the difficult balance of having productive and restful summers.\nFall semester opened with a\nnearly full house at Convocation thanks in large part to our special guest—Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi\n. S.F. Supervisors Rafael Mandelman and Shamann Walton also joined us. All spoke to the importance of higher education and of SF State’s mission to provide access, degree attainment, and upward mobility to California’s diverse population. Supervisor Walton, an alumnus and a Gator parent, shared how a SF State education helped him and his family. Associated Students President Ersa elegantly summarized our role as “a beacon of knowledge, a place where dreams take flight and where students from diverse backgrounds come together in pursuit of a brighter future.\"\nIt was a wonderful way to start the semester.\nLike Ersa, I appreciate the remarkable diversity that characterizes SF State. It is a hallmark of the educational experience we offer. Much higher education news this summer was consumed by the Supreme Court decision to declare affirmative action in college admissions unconstitutional—an action that undoes decades of work to improve access and diversity. I was more than disappointed by the decision as it ignores the reality that race matters, that centuries of systemic racism need systemic redressing. But I was also frustrated by the obsession with admissions to elite universities. They have never been engines of equity enrolling small percentages of low-income and Black and Latinx students.  The work of educating America’s diverse population has been done by SF State, the California State University (CSU), and other comprehensive regional universities.\nIt was refreshing in late July to see the\nSF Chronicle\nacknowledge our mission and role\n. Half of California’s undergraduates attend the CSU, 25% attend UC campuses, and less than one percent enroll at Stanford. The CSU, without question, drives the state’s economy and is the largest driver of the upward mobility of its diverse peoples. The CSU enrolls 41% of the state’s Asian and Asian American students, 50% of its Black students, and 64% of its Latinx students. No education system in the U.S. comes close to this kind of impact.\n“We have so much to be proud of… As we begin the academic year, I encourage all to look for ways to engage and participate in our community…”\nSF State shines within the CSU for its student diversity. As\nthe\nSF Chronicle\nnoted\n, out of the almost 200 institutions offering bachelor’s degrees in California, SF State ranks fourth for Black student enrollment and 12th for Asian and Asian American and Latinx student enrollment. This is something to cherish and celebrate, as are our recent college rankings.\nMoney\nawarded SF State 4.5 out of five stars in their “Best Colleges in America 2023” and\nU.S. News and World Report\nranked us number 15 for “Top Performers on Social Mobility” –  a ranking I value more than I do most other rankings. I share with you all deep pride in our mission to serve students and in our successes, but we must all embrace the need to do far better.\nA\nrecent report by the Campaign for College Opportunity\ndemonstrated that we still have much to do to close equity and opportunity gaps in student outcomes. While lauding us for gains in our graduation rates, the Campaign noted that SF State, and the CSU, will fall short of the goals we set for ourselves for 2025. As I have said before, the greatest demonstration of our commitment to social justice starts here by increasing the success of our students, especially our Black, Latinx, and first gen students.\nAs I look forward to this academic year, I am energized by our work with\nExcelencia in Education\nto become more intentional in our work to support Latinx students and our joint effort with the CSU and USC’s Race and Equity Center to\nelevate Black Excellence\n. Our attention to consistent advising, better completion rates in courses, holistic support for the student experience, and an intentional focus on belongingness will yield results and improve our enrollment. Retaining and graduating our students is our number one priority.\nWe have so much to be proud of. The accomplishments of our students, faculty and staff are amazing, as I detailed in\nmy Convocation remarks\n. As we begin the academic year, I encourage all to look for ways to engage and participate in our community:\nCheck out\nGatorFest!\nLots of opportunities to greet students and say hello to colleagues!\nAttend a Gator athletics game, visit an exhibition, watch a performance, attend a lecture—including a reading by the poet Jessica Care Moore in October.\nJoin us for the second annual Discover SF State for prospective students on October 21st, an opportunity to share your enthusiasm for SF State with prospective students.\nOr just enjoy our beautiful campus in community with one another—gather a group of colleagues or students for lunch at Cesar Chavez or a picnic on the Quad.\nAs always, I thank you for all you do to make SF State a world-class university and a great campus. I wish you all a wonderful academic year.\nBest,\nLynn Mahoney, Ph.D.\nPresident\nTitle IX and DHR update\nJuly 17, 2023\nWith appreciation for your candid feedback and ongoing engagement, I am pleased to update you on our continued efforts to nurture and strengthen a culture of caring, safety, belonging and respect at San Francisco State University and across the California State University (CSU).\nCozen O’Connor law firm has completed its assessment of how the CSU and its campuses respond to reports and incidents of discrimination and harassment. Through a series of interviews, campus visits, survey results and email feedback, they have identified core observations for improvements at both the system and campus levels. The recommendations from this assessment will guide and help us improve our Title IX and Discrimination, Harassment and Retaliation (DHR) training, awareness, prevention, intervention, compliance and support systems.\nThe full report of the systemwide Cozen assessment, including a summary report and a San Francisco State-specific report, can now be found on the\nCSU’s Commitment to Change\nand\nSF State Title IX\nwebsites.\nAs I mentioned in a previous email, Cozen presented an initial\noverview\nof their assessment to the Board of Trustees on May 24, 2023. (You can view a recording of the presentation on\nYouTube\n. The Cozen presentation begins at 23:15.) The state audit of the CSU and four other CSU campuses will also be released shortly. We expect its findings to concur with those iterated by Cozen.\nAs I have also detailed in an earlier email, we assembled SF State’s Cozen Implementation Task Force in Spring 2023 which includes representation from across campus, including faculty, staff and students, to review the findings and advance Cozen’s recommendations. We have a lot of work ahead of us which I am deeply committed to accomplishing. With these important findings and recommendations now in hand, the Cozen Implementation Task Force will commence work at the start of the Fall 2023 semester.\nKey areas of focus and action over the months to come will include:\nCreating processes that foster a welcoming environment and protect academic freedom;\nCreating a culture of care that both complies with legal requirements and fosters an environment in which all behaviors of concern are addressed;\nBuilding trust in our processes and offices;\nReviewing staffing needs;\nImproving data collection in alignment with other CSUs to facilitate consistency and transparency;\nImproving communications, including the website.\nI am grateful to VP Jamillah Moore for her leadership over this work and am pleased to introduce Lori Makin-Byrd to the community. Lori will serve as Acting Title IX Coordinator and DHR Administrator and will serve as co-chair with Jamillah of the Cozen Implementation Task Force. Lori has extensive experience working in the equity and compliance field including as the Senior Advisor to the President for Civil Rights and Title IX Coordinator at the College of Wooster. I am confident that her extensive experience in the field will help to support the work that we’re all dedicated to.\nI am also pleased to announce that we hired a\nSAFE Place\nAdvocate, Nour Loren, who will start August 1, 2023. We will share her contact information with the campus community once she starts. As a reminder, here are current resources for those experiencing harassment and discrimination:\nTo make a report (all students, faculty, staff and/or public) complete this\nonline form\nTo report a crime and to receive emergency assistance: SF State University Police Department, (415) 338-7200,\nupd@sfsu.edu\nFor students:\nCounseling and Psychological Services\n, Student Services Building Room 205, 415-338-2208,\ncaps@sfsu.edu\nFor employees:\nEmployee Assistance Program\n, 1-800-367-7474\nOff-campus:\nSFWar\n(San Francisco Women Against Rape): 3543 18th Street, Suite 7, 415",

    "content": "Denny Luther ’65: “SF State Did Me Right”\nAuthor:\nJim Muyo, University Development\nMay 21, 2025\nPhoto Credit:\ncourtesy of the SFSU College of Science & Engineering. Dennis and Barbara Luther at a student research showcase.\nWith a life that has spanned continents, Dennis “Denny” Luther (B.A., Business Administration, ’65) helps students chart their own paths through his family's philanthropic support\nFrom humble beginnings in Placerville, Calif., to the glitz of San Francisco, a two-year stint in the Army in Alaska in the ’60s, living in a van while touring throughout Europe in the ’70s, and finally landing back in San Francisco, the global trek of Dennis “Denny” Luther ’65 is as impressive as his career trajectory and as noble as his desire to help students secure an SFSU education.\nMind you, Denny’s is no ordinary story. Rather, it’s one filled with calculated choices. His decision to attend SFSU ultimately led to a successful career as a computer programmer who, along with his business partner, built, grew, and sold their company. Denny will be the first to tell you that he wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. In fact, he had doubts that he would even be successful in college and beyond. That success, though, is well proven, and Denny is happy to share the fruits of that success by lending a helping hand to students in need.\nDespite his claim that he was not a great student, Denny applied to and was accepted at San Jose State, Fresno State, and SF State. “I picked San Francisco. That’s where the Giants and Niners were and that’s where you could see a good Broadway play,” he says with a laugh.\nTurned out to be a great decision. Focusing his studies on business and inspired by his success in classes in Statistics and Programming, Denny graduated with a degree in Business Administration with an emphasis in Quantitative Management. From SFSU, Denny was off to his Army stint where he served as editor of the base newspaper in Alaska. He returned to California and was hired as a salesman for Univac as business computing gained wider acceptance.\nSales, however, were not Denny’s strength. Discouraged, he was about to quit Univac, but his manager saw something in him that stood out and Denny was moved over to support businesses that bought or leased Univac computers. This gave Denny the chance to develop his programming skills to the point where he was teaching companies with computers how to program them to maximize their efficiency. Soon, however, the appeal of travelling across Europe captured his attention, so Denny gave up his Univac job.\nAfter living in a van as he traversed through London, Amsterdam, France, Germany, Spain, and Morocco, Denny returned to San Francisco and connected with an SFSU fraternity brother, Tom Luther (no relation), and tended bar in his restaurant a few nights a week. In the upper floors of the building that housed the restaurant, Denny’s future business partner and former IBM salesman Jack Baird was making a living as a computer programming consultant, focusing on getting doctors, dentists, medical groups, and hospitals to sign up for medical and dental billing services. The benefit for the businesses was that with the computerized billing systems, they would get paid in just a week instead of the traditional 30 to 45 days.\nDennis and Barbara Luther\nDennis and Barbara Luther at a student research showcase\nDenny and Baird teamed up and gained more clients to handle electronic billing to Medicare, Medi-Cal, and other large insurers. Their business, Data Systems Group, caught on, and was purchased by Bluebird, which has since been acquired by Experian Healthcare.\nAs Denny says, “My party line is I woke up on January 1, 2013 with money in the bank and time on my hands.” As part of the sale, Denny set up a donor advised fund (DAF). A devout Christian, Denny and his wife Barbara share a passion for tithing and they have chosen, through their DAF,\nto set up a scholarship for SFSU undergraduate students who are majoring in Computer Science, are the first generation in their family to go to college, and who have demonstrated financial need.\n“It breaks my heart,” Denny said when asked about his motivation for setting up the scholarship. “College is so damned expensive, and you can’t go there on your own. I’m hoping that this will help them through school and they’ll have a college degree and one thing will lead to another, and then to another.”\nMuch like one thing led to another and another for Denny, he’s hoping that recipients of the Luther Family Scholarship will find the financial support he and Barbara offer impactful to put them on the course to life-changing learning experiences.\n“It breaks my heart. College is so damned expensive, and you can’t go there on your own. I’m hoping that this will help them through school and they’ll have a college degree and one thing will lead to another, and then to another.\"\n—Dennis Luther (B.A., Business Administration, ’65)\nDenny is grateful that he attended SFSU, something he calls a wonderful experience. “I still have friends from State. I wasn’t sure that I had the wherewithal to be a college student, but then in my sophomore year I got a B in biology and said, ‘Well, I can do this!’”\nNot only could he do it, but Denny did it very well. And, today he stands by the words on the customized donor brick he placed outside of the Nassar Family Gym: “Denny Luther ’65, SF State Did Me Right.”\nDonate to the College of Science & Engineering\nFor more information, contact:\nDavid Fierberg, MNA, CFRE\nExecutive Director of Development\ndfierberg@sfsu.edu\n(415) 405-3966\nRead more about David\nTags\nscholarship\ndonor\nLFCoB\nbusiness\nCoSE\nCompSci\nalum\nRelated News\nSFSU School of Design Students Take Climate Innovation to Global Stage\nSeptember 30, 2025\nAngela Tafur, First Kirkeberg Scholar, Leads with Purpose\nSeptember 30, 2025\nKenneth S.

Handshake is SF State's online job and internship career platform for our students. Employers can use Handshake to post jobs and internships, as well as register for recruiting events, and sign up for On-Campus Interviewing.\nJoin the SFSU Handshake today!\nGo To Handshake ➔\nFrequently Asked Questions About Handshake:\nHow do I create a Handshake account?\nGo to\nhttps://joinhandshake.com\nand click \"Employers\" in the top left corner. Then, click \"Sign-up for an account\" link on the top right corner. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided by Handshake to register.\nI requested to join SF State's Handshake network. Why hasn't my request been approved yet.\nUnder normal circumstances it typically takes 3-5 days to process pending employer approval requests. If your request is not complete in this timeframe, please log into Handshake and check your notifications for any comments on your registration. If you have an urgent need to post a job or internship listing for SF State students, please contact us at\nrecruit@sfsu.edu\nor (415) 338-1764.\nHow do I post a job/internship on Handshake?\nPlease\nlog-in or create a FREE account.\nOnce you are logged in, click on the \"Post a Job\" button to complete the job form.\nI created a job posting. Why does it take a few hours/days for it to appear?\nWhen you submit your posting, it's added to a queue that includes all of the other pending positions awaiting approval from CLD. Depending on the day and staff availability, our queue may contain a 100+ postings in it. And while we try to review them as quickly as possible (many are cleared within hours of posting), on occasion there is heavy traffic on Handshake, or other internal demands (events, university holidays, etc.) that may contribute to a delay of a few business days. If you have an urgent need to post a job or internship listing for SF State students, please contact us at\nrecruit@sfsu.edu\nor (415) 338-1764.\nWhy do my job postings need to be approved?\nIt's in our students' best interest for us to screen and verify employers and the opportunities they present. We do our best to ensure that each employer registration is legitimate, and that each posting meets our employer policies and guidelines. By giving us the time to do that, we can trust that you are interested in making our mission to ensure that our students' needs are a priority. We reserve the right to decline postings that are not in the best interest of our students.\nCan students receive academic credit for internships?\nMany students are interested in earning academic credit during their internship or co-op. For a program to be eligible for academic credit, the employer/organization must work in conjunction with a faculty advisor to fulfill specific requirements established by the student's academic department. Often such a program involves little additional effort on the part of the employer. Consult directly with the Deans' or Chairs' offices of appropriate SF State College departments for more information. Some departments have designated internship advisors. You are encouraged to reach out to your department for the most up to date information on internship advisors. US Department of Labor Internship Programs FLSA\nCan I post unpaid internships?\nNo, all internships posted with Career and Leadership Development must conform to wage regulations as outlined by the U.S. Dept. of Labor's Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Please review the Wage and Hour Division's six-point unpaid intern test to ensure that your internship program falls within federal standards.\nHow do I reach out to more students/alumni about my job opportunity?\nWe suggest employers reach out to student organizations.\nGatorXperience\nallows viewers to locate clubs and contacts. And there are hundreds of campus clubs, many of which have a professional focus. It's free for employers to find student groups that may be interested in their organization.\nCan you email out my job description for me?\nThis service is reserved only for a select number of employers and requires employers reach out directly to\nrecruit@sfsu.edu\nfor a more in-depth discussion. Career and Leadership Development receives hundreds of postings and we strive to make sure that we're not \"spamming\" our students. Rather than sending a message through CLD's employer engagement team, employers can target specific student organizations using\nGatorXperience.",

Edwards’ project focuses on Black birth justice, while Maddala’s project focuses on the aftermath of police-involved violence.\nThe grant is named for San Francisco Examiner photojournalist\nFran Ortiz\n, a friend and mentor to generations of Bay Area photojournalists and SF State’s first photojournalism teacher. A film about Ortiz is available at the\nJohn Gorman Archives\n.\nThe Fran Ortiz Photojournalism Grant was created in 2018 by Reuters photojournalist and editor Gary Cameron in partnership with the SF State photojournalism sequence. Cameron was one of Fran Ortiz’s students and the University’s first photojournalism graduate.\n“I’m particularly proud that the two winning entries of Fran’s Grant for this year are so timely and needed in the current state of affairs in the United States,” Cameron said. “As we moved forward with Fran’s Grant, we too are learning each year regarding the projects submitted, but equally important, the needs of the student to fulfill that project. Congratulations to both Amaya and Harkia; take your projects to the best possible conclusion, grow within yourselves, and be part of a great photographer’s legacy.”\nTags\nStudent Spotlight\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "French Resources\nCheck List for M.A. Students\nDuring the course of your graduate studies, and in order to complete and verify what is stated here, consult frequently the\nDivision of Graduate Studies website\n.\n•\nSEEK GRADUATE ADVISING EVERY SEMESTER.\nStudents\nshould plan their courses in consultation with the graduate advisor and fill out the\n“Advising Worksheet - M.A. student in French”\nevery semester\n. Pay attention to the type of courses and number of units needed to graduate and cross-registration regulations if you want to take courses in universities such as U.C. Berkeley or other universities from the CSU system.\nSend an electronic copy\nto your advisor to keep him/her informed of the courses taken.\n• If you are\nconditionally\nadmitted to the program, seek the advisor for “Advancement to Classified Graduate Standing” when you complete the courses specified as preconditions (Such course work may NOT be used to meet degree requirement).\n• Begin studying early the document containing the “\nReading List”\nof the French M.A. Program and the description of the culminating experience requirements (option I or option II). It is a good idea to begin preparing your reading list for the oral exam early on. It is also a good idea to start reflecting on your preferences concerning the culminating experience requirements. Check\nalso the document:\n“Guidelines Thesis – French”.\nFULFILL THE SECOND LEVEL ENGLISH PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENT.\n•\nAll graduate students must complete Level I and Level II writing English requirements\n. The level I requirement is met when applying to the graduate program, by giving to the French Program a statement of purpose in English (500 words) alongside the same statement written in French.\n• The level II writing requirement needs to be met while in the graduate program. It can be met in the following ways:\nChoice I\n: by submitting for evaluation to the French faculty either a 15-20 page essay written in English for a graduate class (program other than the French Program), or the English translation of a 15-20 page essay written in French for a graduate class from the French Program, unless the French instructor of that class accepts to receive an essay written in English.\nChoice II\n: all students writing a thesis must write a 500/700 word or 2-3 page summary of their thesis in English. An extended version of this summary in English (15 pages) or a 15 page translation of part of the thesis can be submitted for evaluation to the French faculty. In order to fulfill this requirement successfully, discuss how to be best prepared for it with the graduate advisor early in the course of your graduate studies, especially if English is not your first language or if you have deficiencies in writing.\nA SEMESTER BEFORE THE SEMESTER YOU EXPECT TO GRADUATE\nYou will need to fill out and turn in two forms\nat the beginning of that semester:\n“The Advancement for candidacy” (ATC)\nand the\n“Culminating Experience”\n,\ntypically before the third week of instruction.\nCheck the deadlines\n.\nYou will thus have to choose your option for the culminating experience\n(option I or II) by that date.\nAt the same time, decide also how to fulfill the second level English requirement (15-20 page essay written in English or 15 page summary of the thesis written in English).\n• Make an appointment with the graduate advisor\nto discuss your\nATC - i\nt is a good idea to make a first draft of it, and discuss your choice for the\n« Culminating Experience»\nrequirement: you can either take a written and oral. Comprehensive examination (Option I), or an oral Comprehensive examination and write a thesis (Option II). In the second case, you need to choose a topic and a title for the thesis, you also need to choose a thesis committee.\n• When you are ready, fill out the\n“\nThe Advancement for candidacy” (ATC)\nform\nonline, Option I or Option II\nYou will find all necessary forms on the\nforms section of the Graduate website\n. Print it out and have it approved and signed by the graduate advisor. The ATC should show at least 6 units yet to be completed for the degree. If you are making any substitutions for the program requirements stated in the Bulletin, file a petition for ATC substitution along with the ATC.\n• Fill out also the form “\nCulminating Experience\n”\nonline: either\nComprehensive examination (Option I) or 898 Thesis without animal human subject (Option II). On this form, you will write a paragraph summary of your project, give the title of the thesis and list the members of your committee. Any change made later in the title chosen or the composition of the committee will require to fill a new form indicating these changes. As a general rule,\nany change in the content of a form\nsubmitted to Graduates Studies\nwill require submission of a new form.\nPrint it out and have it approved and signed by the Graduate adviser and the members of your committee.\nBoth forms will be signed by the Chair of the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures  and sent together to Graduate Studies by the Department.\n•\nIf you choose the thesis\n, read carefully the document prepared by the French Program: “\nGuidelines Thesis – French\n”. Check the format of the thesis and the administrative requirements at the\nthesis page\n. You will have to present your thesis prospectus to your committee for discussion some time during that semester (one hour). You will also have to take your oral exam at the end of that semester (one hour).\nTHE SEMESTER YOU EXPECT TO GRADUATE\n• Fill out online the form “Application for Award of Degree” on the\nRegistrar's website\ntypically before the third week of instruction of the term you expect to graduate. Check the deadline.\nComplete the Culminating Experience Requirements chosen to obtain your French M.A. (OPTION I or OPTION II).\nIf you chose OPTION I (written and oral exams), you will need to select a date with the graduate advisor towards the end of the semester for taking the written exam (4 hours). The oral exam (1 hour) is typically set two weeks after the written exam. During that semester, meet with the graduate adviser to discuss how to be best prepared for the written and oral exams.\nIf you chose OPTION II (thesis), you should enroll in FR 898 and write your thesis during that semester. Be careful about the calendar you set for yourself in order to submit the final approved copy of your thesis in time to Graduate Studies (check the deadline).\nWhen your Culminating Experience Requirements are completed, obtain the Graduate Advisor’s signature on the form “Report of Completion of Specified Graduate Program Requirements” (not available on line) and file it with the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures Office (which submits the report to Graduate Studies).\nThesis Guidelines\nFOR M.A. FRENCH STUDENTS  WHO ARE CHOOSING OPTION II\nGUIDELINES FOR THE PROSPECTUS AND THE THESIS\n1\n:\n1 This document is based on the guidelines written by the English department of San Francisco State University for the graduate students in the Literature Program. If you are interested, you can consult these guidelines on the site of the graduate program of the\nEnglish Program\n. We adapted them to the specific requirements of the French Program and the specifications available on line on the\nDivision of Graduate Studies website\n.\n1.\nWHEN TO START THINKING ABOUT WRITING A THESIS\n? It is a good idea to think about it early in your graduate studies. You are technically supposed to write it during your last semester, when you are enrolled in FR 898 (Master’s Thesis), but you need to start working on your project much earlier, at least a year before, in order to have the time to choose a topic, reflect about it and exchange ideas, do research, fill up and turn in the required forms in time (see 2 below), present the prospectus describing the project to your committee (usually a semester before taking FR 898), and finally do the actual writing. Be also aware that writing often takes more time than planned, considering the need for revisions and final proofing.\n2.\nADMINISTRATIVE CONSTRAINTS\n.\na) A semester before the end of your studies (before taking the last 6 units of courses necessary for the completion of your M.A.), you must file the\nACT form\n, which is due early in the semester (check the deadlines). Upload the ACT form for the French Program\nOption II\n. Fill the form on line and print it before having it approved and signed by the graduate advisor. Remember that if later you change the courses or the type of culminating experience indicated on your ACT, you will need to fill a new form.\nb) To the ATC you must attach another form: “\nCulminating experience”: 898 thesis\n(No human/animal subjects) (\nOption II\n) available on the same site. File this form on line and print it before having it approved and signed by the graduate adviser and the members of your committee. On this form, you will write a paragraph summary of your project, give the title of the thesis and list the members of your committee. Any change made later in the title chosen or the composition of the committee will require to fill a new form indicating these changes.\n3.\nWHERE DO THESIS IDEAS COME FROM?\nThesis ideas should come from your study of French and francophone literature, culture and language and from your special interests. You may develop a thesis out of a seminar paper or an independent study. Your research papers and/or the suggestions of professors may help you frame and develop a topic. You may also consult bound copies of theses written by French M.A. students in the Library or in the Graduate Reading Room (HUM 473). You should undertake considerable primary and secondary reading in order to convince yourself that your project has worth. The range of possibilities for an M.A. thesis is immense; however, it is preferable to choose a topic corresponding to the types of courses taught and/or interest areas of the French faculty, especially of your first reader. It is also important to think about your future goals, and to be realistic about your time and your abilities. Don’t be overambitious.\n4. HOW LONG SHOULD A THESIS BE?\nLong enough to develop in detail a focused and structured argument. The thesis should extend in scope and conception beyond the range of a seminar paper and be more concise than a dissertation or book-length study. The number of pages depends entirely upon the individual project, but, generally speaking, the range is around 60 pages or a little longer (not to extend beyond 100 pages).\n5. HOW TO FIND MY READERS?\nYour thesis committee can have two or three members. They will most likely be made up of faculty from the French program and the first reader should be a member of the French program. But you may choose another reader from another department or program if it seems appropriate for your topic. Remember that your thesis must be written in French: all your readers should be able to read French. Initially, you must find a first reader from the French faculty who is interested in your general topic and responsive to you and your approach. Your first reader should have some specialization, or at least interested experience, in one or more of the areas of your topic. (For a list of faculty interests and specializations, see the program website) To find such a reader, you must appear with a fairly clear idea and some enthusiasm as well as flexibility. It is recommended that you write down a short description of your project to present to prospective readers. This description should articulate your research questions, list some of the texts you wish to examine, and what you think you might find. Once you have found a first reader, you should discuss who might serve as second and eventually third reader on the committee. If, for any reason, you experience difficulty finding a first reader, you should consult the Graduate Program advisor or the Program Coordinator for advice.\n6. WHAT IS THE PROSPECTUS?\nThe prospectus is a written statement that establishes the main lines of argument and organization for the thesis. It should be developed from your initial description of the project and written in consultation with your committee. The prospectus should present the topic chosen, explain the purpose and significance of the thesis; the approach chosen by you; the selection of literary sources; and an overview of relevant scholarship and criticism.” You should also indicate the time line for remitting each chapter and the final version to your committee. The format might look like this:\n–\nStatement describing the project, its significance and the approach chosen\n–\nChapter outline\n–\nWorking bibliography of major primary and secondary sources\n–Time line for remitting chapters and final version\nA finished prospectus tends to be 8-12pp. in length but can be slightly shorter; a draft is usually submitted to your first reader for commentary and revision before going to the full committee.\n7. PRESENTATION OF THE PROSPECTUS.\nYou will meet with your committee to discuss your project (based upon the completed prospectus) and to evaluate your readiness to start writing. This presentation should be scheduled during the semester before you intend to begin writing, usually towards the end of the semester (or earlier). At the latest, it could be done very early in your final semester but it is not recommended because in this case you may not have enough time to finish writing before the end of that semester. Expect that presentation to last about an hour. First, you’ll be given a chance to explain how you chose your topic and your approach to it. You must be prepared to present and argue the case for a well-delineated plan of research. You will defend or modify your plan of study in response to questions and suggestions from your readers.\n8. ORAL EXAM.\nStudents who chose to write a thesis need to remember that they must also take a comprehensive oral exam where they are tested on their knowledge of French literature in order to receive their M.A. in French. The preparation of this exam should also be planned early, while taking graduate classes. It is the same for option I (written comprehensive exam) and for option II (thesis). To prepare it, you have to select a specified number of readings from the French Reading list of the M.A. Program (see this reading list for more details on the preparation and the format of this exam). The oral exam lasts one hour and takes place with the three members of the French faculty (unless one of them is on sabbatical/unavailable. It should also be scheduled during the semester before you start writing; if not, at the latest, very early in your final semester. Talk with the graduate adviser in order to plan wisely the dates of the presentation of the prospectus and the oral exam.\n9. MAY I CHANGE MY MIND CONCERNING THE CONTENT OF MY THESIS?\nYes, if you mean that your thesis takes different twists and turns as you write. But, if you move completely away from the original proposed topic, you must write a new proposal, develop a new prospectus, and make a new presentation, which implies filling up new forms online.\n10. WHAT ARE THE ROLES OF THE FIRST AND SECOND OR THIRD READERS?\nAt some early stage—perhaps at the end of your oral—readers’ responsibilities will be clarified for your particular project. It may be helpful for the first reader to proceed through the complete manuscript before submitting it to the other readers; sometimes another reader will want to see drafts of chapters immediately after the first reader has perused them or at the same time. Check with your committee to formulate the most appropriate plan of submission. It is important to allow sufficient time for your readers to read and respond to your work, and to apportion time for your revisions and modifications (see 6 above).\n11. LEVEL II WRITING ENGLISH REQUIREMENT?\nTo meet this requirement, students writing a thesis must write a 15-page summary of their thesis in English. This summary will be submitted for evaluation to the French faculty. In order to fulfill this requirement successfully, discuss how to be best prepared for it with the graduate advisor early in the course of your graduate studies, especially if English is not your first language or if you have deficiencies in writing.\n12. OTHER FORMS TO FILL?\nAfter your ACT and “Culminating Experience” forms have been filed, you will sign up for FR 898 (Master’s Thesis) in the first two weeks of your final semester. You will also need to fill out a “report of completion of specified graduate program requirements” and “an application for award of degree” in order to receive your diploma (see 2. above for the site).\n13. HOW DO I SUBMIT MY THESIS?\nBe sure you know the thesis submission deadline for the semester you intend to graduate (check Graduate Division website). You will need to submit the final draft to your committee members with enough time for them to read it and for you to make any last minute changes (usually 2-3 weeks before the published deadline). Theses should follow the latest\nMLA Style Manual\n, available on line, in the Library, the bookstore, or anywhere academic books are sold. Pay attention to the Graduate Division guidelines for formatting and submission. It can be downloaded from its website (look for “Thesis Guidelines” under “Graduate Forms”). You will need to take the final approved copy of your thesis to yours readers for signature. Then you can file it. Remember that you will need to make an extra copy of the thesis for the archives of the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures.\n14. WHAT IF I DON’T MAKE THE DEADLINE FOR COMPLETING THE THESIS AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER THAT I SIGNED UP FOR FR 898?\nYou will be issued a grade of “RP,” which indicates “report of progress”. When you do finish the thesis, there is no new paperwork to file as long as there are no changes to either the original GAP or “Culminating Experience” forms you submitted. If your graduate application was approved but you did not finish your thesis, you will need to re-apply for graduation in the semester that you complete the thesis. Please keep in mind the university’s 7-year limit for completing post-graduate programs: you should endeavor to complete the thesis within 7 years of the date of the earliest course work listed on your GAP form. You will not need to reapply to the university if you need an extra semester to finish your thesis. However, if it takes you longer, you will then have to reapply to the university.",

[link here]\nWhy teach an EXCO course?\nThere are as many different reasons to teach an EXCO class as there are students who have taught or want to teach. Here are just a few:\nDo you want to challenge yourself to develop organizational and leadership skills?\nHave you wanted to pursue in more depth a part of a course you have taken (answer questions that were raised in the course but not answered?).\nIs there a topic you are passionate about and want to learn more?\nIs there a topic you know little about but want to learn more?\nWould you like to belong to a community of learners who want to change society for the better?\nMission Statement\nThe Experimental College at San Francisco State University is committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable educational environment where freedom in teaching and learning is paramount. We inspire students and educators to embrace diverse and flexible teaching methods, fostering creativity, experimentation, and critical pedagogy in a supportive environment free from traditional methodologies and censorship.\nWe prioritize creating networks between EXCO participants and respected subject-matter experts in the community. By fostering these partnerships, we enable students and educators to undertake endeavors not traditionally possible within conventional academic structures.\nWe hope that the ideas and concepts developed here will be extended into the broader curriculum. As a college within the college, EXCO acts as a model for the university to integrate these innovative approaches into mainstream academic programs. We strive to push the boundaries of education, nurturing dynamic, inclusive, and relevant curricula that is responsive to the needs of our community.",

    "content": "Auditory Research Lab\nWelcome to the SFSU-UCSF Auditory Research Lab at San Francisco State University\nThe work of our laboratory is to study how speech recognition in background noise depends on the frequency and timing elements of the noise in individuals with normal hearing and those with hearing loss.\nMission & Vision\nOur mission is to work with individuals with normal hearing and those with hearing loss in determining which aspects of everyday noise cause the most difficulty with communication.  From the knowledge, the goal is to develop therapy or training strategies to improve speech understanding in noisy environments.\nResearch\nPeople\nPublications/References\nParticipate\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nGoal of the lab\nStudies of the auditory system have revealed that it is designed to suppress unwanted background noise such that pertinent environmental and speech signals can be heard with as much accuracy as possible.  However, speech clarity in noisy environments remains an elusive ability for most listeners.  Thus, the accurate recognition of speech in noisy conditions is an important yet not fully understood task performed by the auditory system even for normal hearing listeners.  Further, even mild hearing loss will create a clear deterioration of this ability. One contention is that signal-in-noise (SIN) processing depends on the type of noise that interferes with the speech recognition ability (Oxenham & Kreft, 2016; Schubotz et al., 2016). Recent studies in humans and animals demonstrate that the specific spectral and temporal composition of background noise is a key-determinant in the efficacy of SIN processing (Hochmuth et al., 2015; Oxenham and Kreft, 2016; Homma et al, 2020). In the current study our goals are two-fold: 1) to determine which temporal and spectral modulations present in the noise impede the SIN processing in normal hearing subjects and 2) to explore the influence of different spectro-temporal noise conditions in mild to moderate hearing loss.\nScientific Background\nDetecting acoustic signals in background noise is an important everyday communicative task.  However, the question of how that is accomplished is not fully understood. Of special significance is that speech recognition ability sharply declines in patients with even mild to moderate hearing loss (Wardenga et al., 2015). More research needs to be conducted to determine what aspects of the composition of background noises may increase or decrease the ability to understand speech in the presence of noises.  Previous studies have shown that different types of noise routinely used in audiological assessments, such as pink noise, ICRA noise, multi-talker babble noise, speech noise or white noise, result in differing abilities to recognize speech depending on the character of the noise (Schubotz et al., 2016; Oxenham and Kreft, 2016). However, what is causing these differences due to the nature of each noise is not well understood.  This study will examine the role of more precisely defined spectrotemporal noise compositions on speech recognition in normal and hearing-impaired listeners. This will be done by using a recently developed and validated sentence-in-noise test (Kollmeier et al., 2015) that has been adapted for many languages, including American English (Kiolbasa, 2015). A main advantage of this test is that it uses a randomized selection from a matrix of key words that create grammatically correct but unpredictable sentences (e.g., Hochmuth et al., 2012; Kollmeier et al., 2015). As a consequence, the Matrix test can be repeated many times without learning effects.\nMarcia Raggio, Lab Co-Director (SFSU)\nmraggio@sfsu.edu\nEducation\n1992 PhD, University of California, San Francisco\n1980 M.S., San Francisco State University\n1978 B.A., San Francisco State University\nResearch Interests\nMarcia Raggio, PhD, FAAA is the co-director of the SFSU Auditory Research Lab.  Her research interests involve aspects of the auditory cortical processing of complex signals with a particular interest in how the brain processes speech and noise simultaneously and which aspects of the noise create greater or lesser difficulty.\nChristoph Schreiner, PhD, MD (UCSF), Lab Co-Director\nChristoph.schreiner@ucsf.edu\nEducation\n1977 PhD, University of Göttingen\n1981 MD, University of Göttingen\n1974, M.A, University of Göttingen\nResearch Interests\nMy main scientific goal over the last few decades has been to better understand the cellular properties of auditory cortical neurons in a range of species from rodents, carnivores to nonhuman primates. While we gained much knowledge of neuronal properties in responses to sounds it has become apparent that studying neurons in isolation is not sufficient to account for the processing principles that govern behavior and perception. An increasingly influential hypothesis in neuroscience posits that `cell ensembles', computational units of the brain that consist of multiple, synchronously activated neurons, are essential to consolidate and mediate complex information processing beyond the aggregate power of single cells. We have established in a series of studies the high degree of synchronization of neuron pairs in the inferior colliculus and the auditory cortex (Atencio and Schreiner, 2013; Atencio et al., 2016). In addition, we have identified the presence and basic properties of multi-neuronal ensembles in the auditory cortex (See et al., 2018) and their distinctions in sound encoding to single neurons (See et al., 2020). My goal is to explore further the structure and function of cell ensembles in the auditory forebrain, in particular regarding information extraction and transmission during basic auditory tasks, such as signal detection and discrimination. These studies are necessary to understand the principles inherent in normal hearing as well potential detriments in hearing ability if the operation of cell ensembles is disrupted, e.g., by altered input due to peripheral auditory impairments, aging, or other neuropathological influences.\nLab Assistant Students\nKeleigh Alderman\nHope David\nAndrew Hoffman\nLamont Lee\nPriscilly Medrano\nRylie Velez\nMartha Vergaray\nBeitel RE, Vollmer M, Raggio MW, Schreiner CE.

    "content": "Design Students’ Magazine Raises Money for Native American Coronavirus Fund, Bail Project\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nJune 4, 2020\nPhoto Credit:\nna\nSaddened and frustrated by the tragedies and inequities of COVID-19, a group of Visual Communication Design students printed a magazine of their artistic responses to the federal government’s response.\nBleach, published in May before the nationwide protests against police brutality began, features contributions from 12 undergraduate and graduate students. In the foreword, Assistant Professor Ellen Christensen described the project as a vehicle for anti-racism.\n“The embrace of white poison by racists and nationalists is fundamentally ironic, given the long history of racist and colonialist associations of whiteness with purity,” she wrote. “Both incomprehensibly violent, and fundamentally bizarre, this current political moment necessitates subversive tactics.”\nThe magazine’s first print run sold out; new copies are at the printer. It may be purchased through Bleach’s Venmo account. All proceeds go to charity. A $10 donation goes to the Partnership with Native Americans’ Coronavirus Emergency Response Fund. All donations above $10 will be given to The Bail Project.\nGraduate student Mena Kamel developed the magazine in Jane Rabanal’s Design Management class after feeling frustration and discomfort when the crisis hit. As he learned of friends and family testing positive, he scrapped plans for another class project to instead self-publish something that would offer agency to him and his peers.\nCiting a lack of attention being given to disproportionately high COVID-19 infection and mortality rates among Native Americans, Kamel said he believed a magazine would expand awareness of inequity issues.\n“I’d already been feeling untethered during the transition to online learning and, like everyone, my world got turned upside down pretty quickly,” said Kamel, who will graduate in 2021. “I was spending all my time on theoretical solutions to this massive moment, and that felt so disconnected from what was/is happening in my personal life.”\nKamel said he is grateful for the compassion of his peers, despite the challenges of the pandemic.\n“Many of my peers/contributors have lost their jobs, family members and housing, yet have stayed in school, organized with me and donated their work for this direct action,” he said.\nTags\nStudent Spotlight\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

All courses beyond the first year are taught by experienced professors who hold either a Ph.D. or an Italian doctorate. Even first-year courses are conducted by them, with the assistance of qualified teaching assistants.\nThe number of students in our classes is such that each student receives individual attention. Instructors are always ready to help.\nThe Italian program offers a comprehensive background in literature, linguistics, culture and civilization. These aspects, combined with constant practice in reading, writing, speaking and listening, give students broad educational experience, while a degree in Italian also prepares one for a specialized career.\nMany people study Italian in order to become teachers, but those enrolled in other disciplines have found Italian useful as well. It is particularly pertinent to studies in Music, Art, Cinema, Archeology, International Relations, History, Business and Comparative Literature. At the same time, many are interested in Italian because of the cultural enrichment it offers. The study of Italian can be especially rewarding for those of Italian heritage.\nAll regularly enrolled, full-time students of the San Francisco Consortium may register in a course offered by our program if the desired course is not offered at their home institutions. Applications for cross registration are available at the SF State Registrar's Office.\nAll regularly enrolled students may spend a year at the California International Programs’ Center in Florence or at University of Pavia, where they can pursue their studies in Italian or other fields, receive credit and enjoy some free time to travel.\nA number of scholarships are offered only for undergraduate and graduate students through either the Italian program or the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures. Teaching assistantships are also available for graduate students to teach lower-division classes. A maximum of two courses per semester may be taught.\nDeclare a Major/Minor in Italian\nTo declare a major or minor, complete a\nDeclaration of Major/Minor form\n, then make an appointment to see the program advisor. Bring a copy of your most recent university transcript to the meeting.\nProgram Contacts\nProgram Coordinator:\nFrederik Green,\nfgreen@sfsu.edu\nUndergraduate Advisor:\nFrederik Green,\nfgreen@sfsu.edu\nGraduate Advisor:\nFrederik Green,\nfgreen@sfsu.edu\nResources\nItalian Course Descriptions\nProspective Undergraduates\nRequest Information\nBachelor of Arts\nThe Italian major consists of 30 units of upper-division coursework. Up to 14 units of lower division coursework or demonstrated language proficiency is required for the major.\nProficiency can be demonstrated by completing the necessary lower-division courses or testing out of them.\nMost upper-division courses are conducted in Italian, and students are expected to use Italian in their speaking, reading, and writing.\nCurriculum:\nLower division language classes (14 units)\nITAL 101 First-Semester Italian (4)\nITAL 102 Second-Semester Italian (4)\nITAL 103 Third-Semester Italian (3)\nITAL 104 Fourth-Semester Italian (3)\nCore requirements (15 units)\nITAL 305 Advanced Grammar and Composition (3)\nMLL 325 Linguistics and Foreign Language (3)\nITAL 401 Italian Culture and Civilization (3)\nITAL 510 Italian Literature: Early Period (3)\nITAL 511 Italian Literature: Late Period (3)\nFive upper-division electives on advisement from the following (15 units):\nITAL 350 Advanced Oral and Reading Practice (3)\nITAL 525 Literature and the Risorgimento (3)\nITAL 530 Italian Renaissance Literature (3)\nITAL 550 The Italian Theatre (3)\nITAL 560 The Italian Novel (3)\nITAL 570 Italian Women Writers (3)\nITAL 580 Great Figures in Italian Literature (3)\nITAL 581 Divina Commedia (3)\nITAL 600 Italian Literature on Film (3)\nITAL 699 Special Study (1-3)\nTotal units required for Major: 44\nWriting in the Major\nStudents must complete the University’s GWAR requirement by taking MLL 400GW, CWL 400GW or ITAL 600GW.\nComplementary Studies\nRequired of all candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree in Italian are 12 units of Complementary Studies, which must come from courses bearing a prefix other than ITAL, and not cross-listed with ITAL. Complementary Studies for the Italian major can be satisfied via four possible routes: (1) 12 units in any foreign language other than Italian (which may include up to 3 units of FL prefix courses); (2) 12 units of coursework taken in an approved study abroad program (including the CSU Study Abroad and the SF State Bilateral Program); (3) 12 units of coursework taken as partial completion of a second major, a minor or a certificate; (4) 12 units of coursework in related disciplines with the approval of an Italian Program advisor. Related disciplines typically include classics, linguistics, literature, humanities, philosophy, history, music,art history, education, Jewish studies, apparel design and merchandising, industrial design, and any aspect of greater Italy, Mediterranean, Italian-American or European studies.\nWhere a course with a non-ITAL prefix, (and not cross-listed with ITAL), is taken as a core requirement or elective for the Italian major, the said course may also (doubly) count towards Complementary Studies only via the Study Abroad option or the 2nd Major/Minor/Certificate option listed above. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Foreign Language option are allowed a maximum of 3 units of overlap of FL-prefix courses between Italian major and Complementary Studies units. Students satisfying Complementary Studies through the Related Subjects option are not allowed to double-count major and Complementary Studies units.\nMinor in Italian\nThe Italian minor consists of up to 14 units of lower-division and from 6 to 12 units of upper-division coursework.\nLower-Division Core (0-14 units)\nCourse List\nCode\nTitle\nUnits\nITAL 101\nFirst Semester Italian\n1\n4\nITAL 102\nSecond Semester Italian\n1\n4\nSelect Two:\n6\nITAL 103\nThird Semester Italian\n1\nITAL 104\nFourth Semester Italian\n1\nITAL 206\nItalian Conversation\n1\nThese courses can be fulfilled through AP test credit.\nElectives (6-12 units)\nElectives can include any upper-division course in Italian (ITAL prefix) or a related area selected upon advisement.",

Hough Jr., professor emeritus of Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts, died on January 1 in San Francisco. He was 93.\nBorn in Trenton, Hough was raised at a family-managed cemetery in the New Jersey countryside. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1950 from Rutgers University, followed by a master’s degree from Northwestern University in 1952 and a Ph.D. at the University of Denver in 1955.\nHough served in the U.S. Air Force Reserves from 1949 to 1955, where he attained the rank of second lieutenant.\nHough taught at SF State from 1962 to 1994. For years, his signature SF State course was interpersonal communication. He led an experimental “New School” program at San Francisco State, team-teaching broad themes such as conflict resolution and images of work, time and leisure. In 1973, he was recognized in Outstanding Teachers of America.\nHe created and performed television series in public speaking, communication theory and the California Gold Rush for two network affiliates, culminating with three documentaries on disappearing gold mining processes for the California Division of Parks. His great joy was creating “Oh My Word,” a game show that aired four years on an ABC affiliate.\nHough was predeceased by his parents, Arthur S. Hough Sr. and Naomi (Young) Hough, and his wife, Humanities Professor Emerita Eleanor E. Morrissey.\nTo send flowers to the family in Hough’s memory please visit the website of\nSullivan’s and Duggan’s Serra Funeral Services.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

The reporting process described by this document is part of SFSU's\nstructured approach\n(PDF) to managing incidents.\nStatement:\nThe incident response cycle begins when a suspicious event is observed. Individuals in functional campus areas must either contact their local IT service desk or (in their absence) communicate directly with the\ncentral ITS service desk\nto initiate the\nprocess of handling the incident\n. Depending on the nature of an incident (e.g. burglary, robbery) the end user may also need to contact\nCampus Police\nand file a report.\nInformation security incidents are considered high priority and take precedence over normal SFSU business operations. Managers who supervise functional campus areas must be prepared to manage work priorities, applying their judgment to the scope and impact of an incident in accordance with direction provided by the Information Security Officer.\nThe\nIncident Response Roles and Responsibilities\ndocument (PDF) outlines the duties of the San Francisco State University community regarding the handling of information security incidents with an emphasis on decentralized IT support.\nIn cases where confidential (e.g.\nLevel 1 or Level 2\n) data may be involved, the initial IT point of contact in the corresponding functional campus area must complete an\nIncident Response Form\nand escalate the issue to the ITS Security Team in accordance with the instructions on the Incident Response Form. Isolated, low impact, events that do not put confidential data at risk generally can be handled without using this form.\nImplementation\nResponsibility for implementing this Policy will rest with Information Technology Services (ITS).  Submit any apparent violation of this Policy to the appropriate administrative authority (vice president, dean, director, department, or program chair) or to\nservice@sfsu.edu\n.\nNon-Compliance\nNoncompliance with applicable policies and/or practices may result in suspension of network access privileges. In addition, disciplinary action may be applicable under other University policies, guidelines, implementing procedures, or collective bargaining agreements.",

Thank you for your courage,” he said. “Thank you for your stories. Thank you for your inspiration.

His new book, “The Black Pack: Comedy, Race and Resistance,” offers groundbreaking scholarly analysis on five influential artists of the era: Eddie Murphy, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Arsenio Hall, Robert Townsend and Paul Mooney.\nThese five men joined forces as a comedic collective known as “The Black Pack” and became household names as actors, writers, producers, directors and collaborators. In\n“The Black Pack” (Rutgers University Press)\n, Great cites 24 productions between 1987 and 1994 that defined a generation, both splitting sides and testing boundaries. In a review of “The Black Pack,” the Library Journal praises the book as “an entertaining and essential read.”\n“I call it ‘laugh-tivism.’ The book is a tribute to generations of Black American comedians and how they used their voices to challenge corrupt authority, to confront the racial condition in America and to say very serious things,” Great said. “The book speaks to this notion of revolutionary laughter, but it also speaks to the need for a creative space for laughter as catharsis and the need to create space for Black joy — and to do so through brotherhood and solidarity.”\nRead the full article on SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

The star of the show is Alexandra Lederer, with a four-part installation concerning memories of her late father. In one piece, the full back end of a Camaro convertible juts out of a gallery wall with a boom and sail hanging above it, positioned as if the front of the car has driven through to the “other side.” A U2 album plays on a continuous loop from the car’s speakers. In a gesture she calls “filling his bucket,” Lederer’s installation gives shape to the epic around-the-world journey she and her father intended to take upon his retirement.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Her anthology of political essays\nCall Them by Their True Names\nis on the longlist for the 2018 National Book Award. Solnit has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, the National Book Critics Circle Award in criticism and the Lannan Literary Award for her books.

Boots dropped out of school when the group landed a record deal soon after forming. The Coup went on to release six albums, two EPs and tour the world with signature lyrics that relate life’s daily ups-and-downs to the systemic forces at work. All the while, Boots lived the manifestos from his songs, actively organizing and advocating for working class issues like wealth distribution and stronger unions in his Oakland homebase and beyond.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

After the Six Gallery reading, he ascended into a rarefied stratum.\n“What the Six Gallery really did was show us that there was an audience out there that really wanted to hear poetry off the page,” McClure continues, surrounded by overstuffed bookshelves and clay kiln-fired statues of spirit guides made by his wife, sculptor Amy Evans McClure. The decor reflects McClure’s own obsessions with Asian, Native American and abstract art. “That night at the Six Gallery greatly inspired us to go ahead.”\nFluidly gliding through worlds, McClure bridged the gap between Beats, hippies and Hell’s Angels. He invented his own “beast language” and growled those poems to the lions at the San Francisco Zoo. It’s right there to watch on YouTube. His early psychedelic experiments and subsequent “Peyote Poem” blew the mind of Francis Crick, who would soon co-discover the structure of our DNA. Among other songs, McClure co-wrote “Mercedes Benz,” which was soon turned into a hit by his close friend Janis Joplin.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Awardees were honored November 15 for their outstanding dedication to change and community service work.\n“As a dedicated educator at San Francisco State University and at (California College of the Arts), you have filled the gaps teaching community arts classes, emphasizing ideals of service learning, civic engagement and issues of diversity,” AHC Executive Director Kokomon Clottey wrote in a letter to Jones. “As a creative warrior for change you have emphasized media literacy, analysis skills, nuanced, non-stereotypical, representation of cultural vernaculars.”\nIn turn, AHC has won this year’s Community Partner Recognition Award from SF State’s Institute for Civic and Community Engagement. The Community Service Learning program, a unit within the institute, recognizes and honors one community partner each year for contributing to service learning on campus and in the region. The award was announced in October.\nAHC has worked with Jones and his students for years, through its ArtEsteem program and assisting the agency with marketing expertise. ArtEsteem is an art and literacy program that has helped develop creative, engaged and successful youth by building knowledge and emotional, social, academic and intellectual skills. The program has reached more than 50,000 youth and adults and provided programs to about 57 schools in the East Bay. Jones and AHC staff have served as mutual inspirations and unwavering supporters since first connecting through his Community Arts Design Studio course.\n“Students that work with the Attitudinal Healing Connection have an opportunity to understand what it takes to create sustainable programs in communities. They have an understanding of what it means to work hands on with young people, with families and with individuals to become empowered,” says Amana Harris, AHC associate director. “ …. This is about making a difference — not only in your own life, but also in the lives of many people that live and work and go to school in community.”\nVideo\nLinks\nOakland Post article, October 25, 2014\nAttitudinal Healing Connection\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts interview with Steve Jones, August 25, 2010\nInstitute for Civic and Community Engagement\nSteve Jones\nNews Article",

He wrote the piece while serving as the magazine’s editor.\nCCMA supports college journalism students and holds the contest annually to honor excellence in college journalism and hosts an annual awards contest for college journalism students.\nAshworth’s winning story is about the long-term effects of the communities affected by the Tubbs, Camp and Carr fires. “The smoke that covered the Bay Area for nearly two weeks last November showed how this problem isn’t one that only affects rural populations,” Ashworth said via email.\n“Boone’s story was amazing and we are very proud of the work he did on it,” Journalism Department Chair Cristina Azocar said. “Many students and faculty were affected by the fires, and we are happy to support his travel to the awards banquet in San Diego.”\n“This story wouldn't have happened without the encouragement of our adviser, Don Menn, and the outstanding abilities of my editorial team. Seriously, they're the best,” Ashworth said via email.\n— Sydni Tanner\nLinks\nOut of the Fire, Up in the Air, Xpress Magazine, December 21, 2018\nCalifornia College Media Association\nJournalism Department\nMedia Contact:\nMatt Itelson, 415-338-1442, matti@sfsu.edu, College of Liberal & Creative Arts, San Francisco State University, 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, California 94132\nNews Release",

    "title": "Alumni in a Publishing Flurry: Memoir, Young Adult Fiction, Short Stories, Poetry",
    "content": "Wednesday, June 24, 2015\nJust in the past few months, at least six books by Creative Writing alumni have hit the shelves. With a variety of genres — memoir, young adult fiction, short stories, poetry — widespread acclaim follows these titles, reflecting the continued eminence of the Master of Fine Arts program in the literary world.\nMolly Giles\nMolly Giles’\nAll The Wrong Places\n(Lost Horse Press/Willow Springs Editions) won the 2013 Spokane Prize, as “a wild and adventurous read.” The collection’s 19 strange, tightly woven tales merge the mythic and the modern with dark humor and deep humanity. Many of the stories contain contemporary versions of ancient guides: a ghost dog seen by a young drifter in love with a much older guru, a wild goat on a cliff forever standing beside her dead ram glimpsed by a woman whose husband battles cancer, and a volcano goddess with a small dog appearing to a woman whose boyfriend is flirting with her teenage daughter.\nGiles (B.A., ’75; M.A., ’81) is the author of three award winning story collections,\nRough Translations\n,\nCreek Walk\nand\nBothered\n, and a novel,\nIron Shoes\n. Previous awards include the Flannery O’Connor Award for Short Fiction, the Small Press Short Fiction Award, Boston Globe Award, Bay Area Book Reviewers Award, two Pushcart Prizes and a National Endowment for the Arts grant. A professor emerita, she taught at SF State from 1981 to 2001.\nKelly Loy Gilbert\nKelly Loy Gilbert’s debut novel\nConviction\n(Disney-Hyperion) has developed a buzz on the teenage circuit, appearing on numerous summer reading lists and best-sellers charts. “A poignant look at the messiness of love, faith and humanity,” the School Library Journal writes. It explores questions of faith and family through the nuanced story of Braden, a star pitcher whose world is turned upside down when his father is accused of murder.\nLoy Gilbert (M.F.A., ’10) is a fiction writer who believes deeply in the power of stories to illuminate a shared humanity and give voice to complex, broken people. Her writing has appeared in the San Jose Mercury News, Shrapnel and the Kenyon Review. She has served on the NaNoWriMo Associate Board and led creative writing workshops for teens.\nPeter Coyote\nPeter Coyote has remained in the spotlight for his many talents throughout the past five decades. A writer, hippie, activist and actor, Coyote recounts his travels in his second memoir,\nThe Rainman’s Cure: An Irregular Education\n(Counterpoint Press). Kirkus Reviews describes the book as an “artfully rendered chronicle of his intriguing journey from confused, privileged youth to enlightened Zen practitioner.”\nCoyote (attended, ’65) has enjoyed roles in\nE.T.\n,\nErin Brockovich\nand\nCross Creek\n, and narrated more than 120 documentaries for the likes of PBS. He was a prominent figure in San Francisco counterculture, as a founder of the Diggers, which supplied free food, free housing and free medical aid to the hordes of runaways during the 1967 Summer of Love.\nToni Graham\nToni Graham’s\nThe Suicide Club\n(University of Georgia Press) won the 2014 Flannery O’Connor Award for Short Fiction. The people in her eight interlaced stories are “bound together by the worst sort of grief, the kind that can devour you after someone close takes his or her own life.” Wednesday evenings in Hope Springs, Oklahoma, offer the usual middle American options: television, recreation-league sports, eating out and church. For Slater, Holly and SueAnn, it’s when their suicide survivors group meets. Graham (M.F.A., ’96) teaches creative writing at Oklahoma State University, where she serves as editor in chief and fiction editor of the Cimarron Review. Her other short-story collections are also winners —\nWaiting for Elvis\ngrabbed the John Gardner Book Award, and\nThe Daiquiri Girls\ntook home the Grace Paley Prize in Short Fiction.\nQuintan Ana Wikswo\nQuintan Ana Wikswo’s\nThe Hope of Floating Has Carried Us This Far\n(Coffee House Press) is a collection of short stories and photographs. She first derived the book by creation stories told by her parents — a preacher and a physicist.\n“Their stories were perplexingly parallel yet divergent — atoms versus Adam, states of matter, heaven and hell, charged particles, good and evil,” Wikswo says in her artist statement. “I came to realize that the experience of passing in and out of existence is an uneasy one, with no answers, only theories. Unconvinced by their explanations, I concluded I was likely not a human child, and unbound by their rules, I began to create my own.”\nWikswo (M.F.A., ’03) is a writer and visual artist whose work integrates fiction, poetry, memoir and essay with her original photographs, performance and video. Her works are published, performed and exhibited internationally. Her projects have received multiple solo museum shows in New York City and Germany, including the Berlin Jewish Museum. A former human-rights worker, Wikswo uses salvaged government typewriters and cameras to navigate known, unknown and occluded worlds, especially obscured sites where crimes against humanity have taken place.\nJesse Nissim\nJesse Nissim’s full-length book of poetry,\nDay cracks between the bones of the foot\n(Furniture Press Books, 2015), is already a finalist for literary awards, including the top prize from the National Poetry Series Open Competition, first prize from the Cleveland State University Poetry Center’s First Book Poetry Competition, the Kinereth Ginseler Award from Alice James Books, Poets Out Loud Prize from Fordham University Press and Brittingham Prize in Poetry from University of Wisconsin Press.\nNissim (M.F.A., ’05), Humanities Faculty Fellow at Syracuse University, is the author of several poetry chapbooks, including\nNesting Instinct\n,\nSELF NAMED BODY\nand\nAlphabet for M\n. Her book manuscript has been a finalist for the National Poetry Series, Alice James Books Kinereth Gensler Award, Cleveland State University Poetry Center Award and others. She has received grants from the Ragdale and Saltonstall foundations, and her poem “Fire” was selected by Juliana Spahr as the winner of Spoon River Poetry Review’s 2013 Editor’s Prize.\nLinks\nMolly Giles\nKelly Loy Gilbert\nPeter Coyote\nToni Graham\nQuintan Ana Wikswo\nJesse Nissim\nCreative Writing Department\nPhoto: Quintan Ana Wikswo.

Novelist-essayist-poet Boyle, who died in 1992, was one of the expat artists and writers who lived in Paris in the ’20s. In the decades after, she was most famous as a literary figure midcentury. Later, teaching at SF State, she became especially known for political protest, for defying then-President S.I. Hayakawa when students and faculty went on strike. Last week I came upon a letter she sent to the Chronicle in ’89, commenting on a story that said “the solution to the homeless problem in Marin County has been postponed until after Christmas.” That was “sensible,” she wrote, but why not postpone it until after the new year? “The week after Christmas is inevitably a time when innumerable demands are made — such as disposing of the mountain of discarded wrapping and boxes under the Christmas tree.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Around the same time that she graduated from San Francisco State — with a dual degree in urban planning and Political Science — someone suggested that she run for San Francisco’s Democratic County Central Committee, a powerful local voice whose endorsement meetings draw hundreds of people around every election.\n“At first I was like, ‘No, that seems like a beast, I’m starting a new job, I just finished school,’ ” she says. “But the more I thought about it, I kept thinking about how young people are told ‘not now,’ and to ‘wait their turn.’”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

And, aside from roughly 15 years teaching at San Francisco State, Orner has bounced around a lot in his 50 years: Before moving to Norwich last year, Orner — along with his wife, best-selling author Katie Crouch, and their two young children — lived in Namibia as a Fulbright scholar, where he based one of his novels, “The Second Coming of Mavala Shikongo.” Prior to that, he lived and worked all over the Midwest, plus Massachusetts, plus Mexico, plus eastern Europe. There are a lot of places he’s lived for no longer than a year or two — maybe not long enough to put down real roots, but long enough to get the lay of the land, and to be haunted by it after he leaves.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The alliance brings SF State together with Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CSU Dominguez Hills, CSU Fullerton, CSU Los Angeles and Cal Poly Pomona.\nAccording to the proposal, the new curriculum should help “transform early student experience in computing with the integration of socially responsible computing curriculum.” The goal is for students to see the real-world connection in their courses early in the computing program, and the NSF grant will help with the program redesign.\n“Helping students realize that their computational skills can be used to make headway on some of the most difficult societal problems we face is a powerful and empowering experience,” said SF State Associate Professor of Computer Science Anagha Kulkarni. “Systematically providing these experiences to computer science students is the goal of this new alliance.”\nThe six participating universities have identified that a larger percent of underrepresented minority students at CSUs drop out of their computing majors than non-underrepresented minority computing students. Because the largest percentage of underrepresented minority students drop out of their computer science major in the first two years, the goal is for professors to show students through their initial coursework how the study of computer science can influence and impact the communities they are from.\nWith the $1.8 million grant for culturally responsive computing curriculum, the universities will incorporate inclusive STEM pedagogy into early computing courses, with faculty training to support community-centered projects in the coursework. The project organizers will evaluate the new curriculum through peer review and focus on the retention rate of Hispanic and Latino students.\nThe project team aims to establish curriculum and pedagogical changes integrated throughout the first two computing courses to address students’ community needs and employ project-based learning.\nThe grant’s co-principal investigator, SF State Assistant Professor of Computer Science Aakash Gautam, is creating a new introductory programming course (CSC 101) as part of the project. He believes the course will help “broaden the notion of what computing is and can be, and who gets to shape it in the future.”\n“I hope this project and the changes impact our students to renew their concepts about computing and see how relevant and applicable the computing is,” said SF State Professor of Computer Science Ilmi Yoon.\nReminder: feedback sought on University homepage\nA new version of\nthe SF State website homepage\nwent live Friday, Nov. 4, as part of the transition of all University webpages from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.

The event was titled “Unsettling Museum Exhibits: International Prospects for Paradigm Shifts in Native Community Collaborations.”\nThe roundtable centered on the following question: What new paradigm shifts in museum practice lend to greater collaborations with Native American communities and individuals and enable exhibitions to illuminate the agency behind material culture? To explore this question, the panel brought into conversation European and U.S. anthropologists, museum practitioners and members of the Native American advisory board for the Field Museum exhibition\n“Native Truths: Our Voices, Our Stories.”\nThey discussed the changing relationships between museums and Native American communities and individuals and the best practices that enable museum practitioners to create exhibits that go beyond colonial and settler discourse.\nAfricana Studies Professor Dorothy Tsuruta presents at renowned Bay Area event\nAfricana Studies Professor\nDorothy Tsuruta\nwas invited by the Village Project to serve as presenter and praised at this year’s annual, now famous Black Bay Area community event that recognizes several individuals and organizations with Lifetime Achievement Awards and proclamations by political officials.

Professor of Geography and Environment\nEllen Hines\nat the Estuary and Ocean Sciences Center is among the international researchers on this paper.\nReview of the last two decades of literature revealed that the major threats to cetaceans continue to be habitat degradation and fishery interactions. Conservation efforts via cetacean-specific protected areas, habitats that mirror a species’ natural habitats, community-led conservation and educational programs show promise. The authors propose steps to further improve conservation but note the need for additional research and transnational political will.\nLogan writes for Jacobin, New Labor Forum on Starbucks labor organizing\nJohn Logan\n, professor and chair of Labor and Employment Studies, recently wrote articles for\nJacobin\nand\nNew Labor Forum\nabout the “high-octane” unionization efforts that have fueled Starbucks workers nationwide.\nBoth articles analyze the resounding successes despite an intense union-busting campaign. “In less than a year, Starbucks Workers United has gone from having zero to 258 unionized stores,” Logan noted in Jacobin.\nIn New Labor Forum, Logan states that media coverage and social media have given millions of Americans “an education in how powerful anti-union corporations abuse and exploit weak labor laws” and has potential to spark “an organizing wave across the low-wage service sector.”\n“The new American labor movement might just have started at a coffee house in Buffalo,” he writes.\nMcDaniel discusses SF elections\nPolitical Science Associate Professor\nJason McDaniel\nhas provided his perspectives on San Francisco elections to media outlets more than five times this month, including in the\nSan Francisco Public Press\nand\nSan Francisco Chronicle\n.

She and Lily Jamali talked about facing their complicated identities.\n“Whether we know it consciously or not, we have been affected by the news.

So imagine, for most Americans, that’s all they know,” said Karim, director of the Center for Iranian Diaspora Studies at San Francisco State University. “...

The Republicans stole the courts and Democrats must ‘un-steal’ them,” Belkin says. “Yes, a robust national conversation about various reform options is needed. And yes, there is a strong case to be made for some of the options. But un-stealing the courts is the only viable path to nullifying and penalizing Republican misconduct. Expansion, in other words, is the only option that imposes a proportionate political penalty for theft.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, March 13, 2018\nSAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE -- Hirayanagi grew up in Chiba, Japan, moved to Los Angeles for high school and studied acting at San Francisco State University before deciding to get behind the camera. She has lived in Noe Valley since 2014 with her husband, daughter, 10, and son, 5.\nDuring a conversation at the San Francisco Public Library branch on Jersey Street, just blocks from Hirayanagi’s home, where she wrote drafts of her script, she recalled how, in Japan, she “answered the questions in class,” was a “tomboy who played soccer with the boys” and even had a rebellious streak. Yet cultural dislocation as a teenager intensified her natural shyness — an experience she has wanted to explore as a storyteller ever since.\nHirayanagi first probed the idea in her master’s thesis film, a 22-minute character sketch (also titled\nOh Lucy!\n) about a midlife Tokyo loner, Setsuko, whose days are spent shuffling between her monotonous office job and tiny, cluttered apartment, and whose only close bond is with her free-spirited niece. Only when Setsuko enrolls in an English-language class with a charismatic American instructor, who insists she wear a blond wig and take on an American alter-ego, Lucy, does she begins to emerge from her shell.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

In Jerusalem, Tigay visited the home Shapira lived in after becoming wealthy, and went to the Christian church where Shapira worshiped, married and baptized his two daughters.\nIn the U.S., Tigay made one final stop — the Adolph Sutro Library at San Francisco State — and found what he called “the most important discovery of the entire journey,” eight days before the book was due. “I had to rewrite the entire ending.”\nSo how does the story end?\n“I’m not giving anything away,” Tigay said. “I think it holds interest whether it’s real or fake.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

She returned in 1978 and never left.\nThe tight-knit community of artists in the city has remained nurturing despite great odds. Before Katrina struck, Deckbar was scheduled to show her work in a group show in October. The show went on and became a galvanizing moment in the city’s art scene.\nShe said she continues to find water unsettling. Even an event as innocuous as watching July Fourth fireworks on the lake had her focused on the water and the strength it yielded 10 years ago.\n“We’re living on the edge here. It’s fragile; it’s below sea level; it’s an old city. I do believe we can stave off the threat of nature somewhat longer. But how much longer? I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t dwell on it.

During this time, he worked with some Bay Area radio legends Jim Lange and Carter B. Smith and then ultimately landed his own time slot — spinning classics and swing tunes. It was almost surreal.

We’re excited about the possibility of collaborating with your organization or department and connecting you with our campus community in ways that support your mission and offer meaningful learning experiences for students.\nWhether you are an\noff-campus community partner\nor an\non-campus department or program\n, the first step in initiating a partnership is registering in\nULink\n, SF State’s official digital platform for community engagement. This helps us learn more about your site and the learning opportunities you would like to make available to students, including any relevant safety protocols. The registration should be completed by someone familiar with the learning activities students will be involved in and your safety policies and procedures.\nSF State collaborates with organizations and departments across a wide range of sectors to provide\napplied learning opportunities\nfor students, including\ncurricular (for-credit)\n,\nco-curricular (non-credit)\n,\npaid\n, and\nunpaid\nroles. All partners—both off-campus and on-campus—must complete the ULink registration process.\nIn addition:\nOff-campus partners\noffering\nopportunities\nwill also be asked to sign a\nLearning Placement Site Agreement (LPSA)\nto formalize the partnership.\nOn-campus departments and programs\nwill instead be sent an\nOn-Campus Learning Placement Site Acknowledgement\nform to confirm alignment with university protocols for student learning and safety.\nIf you represent an\nSF State student organization\n, please use the\nSF State Activities & Events platform\nto post available roles, as this is the appropriate space for student-led, on-campus opportunities.\nThe\nInstitute for Civic & Community Engagement (ICCE)\ncoordinates and provides administrative support for academic internships, community service learning, and related partnerships.

As you complete the LSA, you will also be asked to provide a detailed description of the service-learning or internship opportunities available at your organization. You can upload an existing position description that you already have available. If you already have a student placed in your organization, please upload their current position description/tasks. This information helps match SF State students with roles that align with their skills and interests. This will also help ICCE be able to more effectively promote your available opportunities.\nRegister with ULink\nULink How to Register Guide\n2) Review & DocuSign University-Partner Organization Agreement\nOnce your ULink registration is completed and reviewed, we will then send you a\nLearning Site Placement Agreement (LPSA\n)\nfor review and signature.\nWhen the Agreement is executed by all parties, ICCE will then approve your organization in ULink and you then will be able to have full access to ULink to create and post your opportunities.\nNeed help or have questions?

This ensures alignment with university protocols and enables ICCE to support your student placements appropriately. This applies to all non-clinical roles, including departments or programs that may have hosted students in the past but are not yet registered in ULink.\nRegistration involves two simple steps:\nRegister as an “Organization” in ULink.\nComplete the Learning Site Assessment (LSA): Site Requirements & Safety Information.\nAs part of the LSA, you’ll be asked to provide a short description of the internship or service-learning opportunities your department offers. You can upload an existing position description, or if a student is already placed, the tasks they are currently completing. This helps match SF State students with roles that align with their academic and career interests and allows ICCE to highlight your opportunities more effectively.\nRegister with ULink\nULink How to Register Guide\n2) Review & DocuSign the SFSU On-Campus Learning Placement Site Acknowledgement\nAfter your registration is reviewed, ICCE will send you the\nOn-Campus Learning Placement Site Acknowledgement\nform. This form confirms your department’s understanding of and commitment to university expectations related to student learning and placement. Once signed by all parties, your department will be approved in ULink and able to post and manage student opportunities directly through the platform.\nNeed help or have questions?

    "content": "Nutrition Clinic\nSchedule a free one-on-one appointment with a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) for individual nutrition support.\nAnjuman Shah, MS, RDN focuses on offering evidence-based, person-centered, compassionate care rooted in a non-diet approach, health at every size (HAES) perspective, and mindfulness strategies. She aims to promote optimal health and well-being by helping students build a positive relationship with food and their bodies.\nCommon reasons for working with a RDN:\nMedical concerns involving nutrition management (e.g. diabetes, celiac disease, eating disorders, digestive conditions, heart health)\nFamily history of nutrition-related health conditions (e.g., high cholesterol, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, anemia)\nMental health conditions that impact eating (e.g. depression, anxiety, ADHD)\nDigestive issues and/or changes in appetite or energy levels\nFood allergies and intolerances\nVegetarian/vegan nutrition support\nImproving your relationship with food and your body\nFueling for exercise/sports\nOther eating or nutrition-related concerns\nNutrition Specialties\nWhile the Registered Dietitian can support you with any health goal, Anjuman specializes in the following areas:\nDigestive conditions\nDisordered eating, mindful eating, and body image\nPlant-based nutrition\nDiabetes and other chronic condition management\nDietary supplements\nInitial Appointments (50 minutes)\nFor students who have never seen the RDN or not seen the RDN in over a year\nIncludes nutritional assessment, counseling, education, and goal setting\nPlease fill out the online nutrition questionnaire at least 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment.\nNote: You have 40 minutes to fill out the questionnaire and cannot return to the form once submitted to add more information. Please provide as much detail as possible.\nFollow-up Appointments (25 minutes)\nFor students who have seen the RDN within the last year\nOngoing counseling, monitoring, and support in achieving desired health goals\nLooking for more support with improving your eating habits, eating on a budget, meal planning, grocery shopping, meal prepping, and/or other general nutrition concerns?\nJoin our FREE nutrition workshops, cooking demos, and cooking classes happening throughout the school year.\nUpcoming Events\nYou can also check out our online\nnutrition resources\nand\nrecipes\nfor more inspiration and guidance!\nClinic Hours:\nWednesdays:\n10am - 5pm\nAppointments:\nAppointments are currently held virtually via Zoom video chat. If you miss your appointment or do not cancel/reschedule prior to your visit time, you will be billed a $20 no-show fee.\nIn-person appointments are available upon request only.\nAll in-person appointments will take place at\nStudent Health Services\n.\nCost:\nCovered by the Student Health Fee\nTo schedule an appointment, book online through MyHealth or call Student Health Services at 415-338-1251\nMake an Appointment\nFAQ\nI want to lose weight. Can the Registered Dietitian help me with this goal?\nWeight and BMI are poor and inaccurate measures of health – in fact, current BMI ranges are based mainly on white populations and do not take body composition (including muscle mass, body fat percentage, and bone density) into account. BMI does not account for biological and genetic differences in the relationship between weight, muscle mass, and disease risk among different groups of people.\nResearch shows that intentional weight loss may negatively impact health, especially when weight is lost too quickly. Incorporating consistent and balanced eating and lifestyle behaviors improves overall health and well-being regardless of weight change, and our Registered Dietitian can support you in achieving good health at any size.\nThe number on a scale does not define you, your health status, or your abilities. For more information on how intentional weight loss does not support improved health outcomes, please visit\nHAEShealthsheets.com\n.\nWill I be put on a diet?\nNo. We define “dieting” here as any attempt to change body size through food and/or movement. Research shows that diets don’t work and may actually result in a negative relationship with food, weight gain (oftentimes even more than initially lost from dieting), and worsened health outcomes.\nAll food is designed to provide energy to the body – however, the amount and quality of energy received varies based on the quantities and combinations consumed! Maximizing variety and minimizing unnecessary restrictions is the best way to keep eating consistent, joyful, and exciting. Our Registered Dietitian will work with you to find an optimal balance of foods that works best for your body.\nFor more information on how dieting does not support health and well-being, please visit\nHAEShealthsheets.com\n.\nWill the Registered Dietitian tell me what to eat (or what not to eat?)\nNot quite. Our Registered Dietitian believes all foods can fit into a healthy and happy lifestyle, which means that she won’t tell you to avoid or cut out any of your favorite foods unless it is medically necessary (e.g., if you have a food allergy).\nOur Registered Dietitian will learn about your food beliefs and eating preferences and help equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to build balanced meals in any setting and achieve your nutrition-related health goals.\nWhat is the difference between a Registered Dietitian (RD) and a nutritionist?\nIn a nutshell, all Registered Dietitians are nutritionists, but not all nutritionists are Registered Dietitians.\nRegistered Dietitians are nutrition professionals who must:\nHave a Bachelor’s and/or Master’s degree in food and nutrition sciences\nComplete a minimum of 1,200 hours of supervised practice\nPass a rigorous examination to become licensed\nComplete continuing education hours in order to maintain their credentials\nThe term “nutritionist” isn’t regulated, so anyone can call themselves one. While you can find qualified nutritionists with proper education and training, there are also many people calling themselves nutritionists who have little to no education and training (especially on social media). These self-declared “nutritionists” may offer misleading, ineffective, and oftentimes\nharmful\nnutrition advice. If you are seeking evidence-based nutrition advice and support, especially for medical conditions, a Registered Dietitian is your best bet.\nHow long do I need to work with the Registered Dietitian to achieve results?\nThe choice is yours! Exact timing depends on you, your schedule, your specific health goals, and the level of support and accountability needed to achieve them.\nBuilding and maintaining consistency with new habits takes time and practice – we usually recommend working with a Registered Dietitian regularly (i.e., weekly or bi-weekly) for at least 6 months for optimal results.\nOur Registered Dietitian can better assess the length of time needed to achieve long-lasting results after completing an initial consultation. Once started, you always have the option to meet less frequently or on an as-needed basis as you build more comfort and confidence with your eating.",

So more and more people are becoming citizens, registering to vote and getting involved. “I think we‘re going to have very high Asian American turnout nationally ... and particularly in the battleground states of Nevada and Virginia.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

But when you’re part of a marginalized, often underrepresented community — LGBTQ seniors, for instance — it can be extra tough. San Francisco State University Lecturer of Health Education Deborah Craig and former San Francisco State student Véronica Duport Déliz shed light on those barriers through a short film that has a humorous yet poignant take on aging.\nCo-directed by Craig and Déliz, the documentary\nA Great Ride\nlooks at older lesbians who live in several different communities in Northern California.

He also handles donor relations, which includes reaching out to potential donors and cultivating relationships with them.\nHe started his stand-up comedy career during his student days at San Francisco State University, trying his hand at clubs like Holy City Zoo, The Other Cafe and The Punch Line. “I was probably one of the younger would be stand-up comedians at age 18 at the time.”\nHe became one of the founding members of Fil-Am comedy troupe Tongue In A Mood, whose other founders include Kennedy Kabasares, Rex Navarette and Allan Manalo (who went on to reconfigure Bindlestiff Studio in San Francisco into a Filipino American performance venue and theatre group).\nMuriera became involved in theater work by way of a professor and a classmate. “My Filipino American Studies instructor, Oscar Peñaranda, announced auditions by the Asian American Theater Workshop (which later became the Asian American Theater Company) for two one-act plays that he had written.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Former Student Boots Riley's 'Sorry to Bother You': 'Anti-Capitalist Parable with Flair and Bite'",
    "content": "Monday, December 10, 2018\nTHE INDEPENDENT (LONDON) -- Riley fits snugly within the definition of artist-activist. It’s a draw he’s felt since childhood. He was born in 1971 in Chicago, to parents who had met during a student-led strike at San Francisco State University. His father volunteered as a housing and welfare rights advocate and a car industry organizer before working as a civil rights and criminal-defense lawyer.\nHis parents moved to Oakland, California, when Riley was six and by the time he was 15 he had joined the radical Progressive Labor Party. In 1991, he co-founded The Coup, acting as primary lyricist. Their work was deliberately confrontational, with album titles such as\nKill My Landlord\n(1993) and\nPick a Bigger Weapon\n(2006), although he recently dismissed the former as “a pamphlet on tape,” adding he’s now more interested in speaking to audiences who don’t directly identify with his politics.\nWhich is exactly what\nSorry to Bother You\nsets out to achieve, aided by a cast of recognizable faces as Tessa Thompson and Armie Hammer also star. The film takes the familiar tropes of dystopian fiction — corporate giants as sinister authoritarian forces, for example — and places them distinctly in today’s timeline. Riley’s point is that dystopia is now, and always has been.\nPhoto: Boots Riley (left) and actor Lakeith Stanfield on the set of Sorry to Bother You.

    "content": "‘Boundaries are crossed, but new ones form’: Professor reflects on LGBTQ movement\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson, SF State News\nJune 6, 2022\nPhoto Credit:\nPhoto by Hannah Anderson\nUC Press publishes ‘Queer Public History: Essays on Scholarly Activism’ by Marc Stein, the Jamie and Phyllis Pasker Professor of History\nOver the last 40 years, San Francisco State University Professor Marc Stein has played multiple roles in the fight for LGBTQ rights and liberation. He has protested in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, reported for Gay Community News and written books and essays revealing little-known historical events.\nHis new book,\n“Queer Public History: Essays on Scholarly Activism”\n(University of California Press), is a collection of more than 30 pieces he has written primarily for newspapers, magazines and blogs over the years.\nStein\nis San Francisco State’s Jamie and Phyllis Pasker Professor of History. He joined the University in 2014.\nWhat motivated your new book?\nPerhaps because I was a journalist in the 1980s (first as the editorial page editor for my college newspaper and then as the coordinating editor of a national gay and lesbian newspaper), I’ve long been interested in writing for larger public audiences that would not be reached by lengthy scholarly essays or books. I thought it would be interesting to reflect on change and continuity in how queer historical writing influences and is influenced by public audiences (queer and not) and how academic and community-based scholars have worked together to make queer history.\nThe book also includes essays on scholarly activism, meaning scholarship written and used for activist purposes. Some academics think that scholarship is tainted by association with activism, but activism was necessary to make a place for queer history in higher education.\nWhen reviewing and reflecting on your past writings, what emotions and memories struck you?\nWell, the book includes personal essays that address the political depression and despair that I’ve experienced as a gay man, as a social justice activist and as a young queer studies academic struggling to find a place within higher education. At the same time, working on the book made me reflect on the importance of tenacity and resiliency, the value of political emotions (including anger, disappointment and frustration), and the life-sustaining power of friendship, mentorship, community, solidarity and humor.\nWhat does the book reveal about the state of LGBTQ people in America today compared to when you first became involved in activism and scholarship? What progress has been made and where are areas of growing concern?\nI think even the most cynical and pessimistic among us can recognize that in many areas, LGBTQ people have experienced remarkable progress over the last several decades. At the same time, the best queer historians — and the best historians — are skeptical about linear progress narratives.\nChange can lead to backlash. New freedoms come with new regulations. Boundaries are crossed, but new ones form. Some gain; some lose. If we take the example of how queer history is taught in primary and secondary schools, we now have states that mandate inclusion, and we have other states that are mandating exclusion. That doesn’t align with a straightforward (pardon the pun) narrative of progress or a straightforward narrative of declension.\nOn June 14, you will give a talk at the San Francisco Public Library about the emergence of LGBTQ activism at SF State. What developments will you discuss?\nThe talk, titled\n“Queer Transformations at San Francisco State, 1969 – 1972,”\nis timed to coincide with the amazing\nQueer History Conference\n, which will bring hundreds of scholars, teachers, students and others from around the country and world to our campus. (Our incoming provost, Amy Sueyoshi, is one of the conference organizers.)\nMy presentation draws on a multiyear collaborative research project that I’ve undertaken with two SF State classes, which explored sexual politics at SF State in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I’ll be exploring the early emergence of LGBTQ activism at our University, including queer support for\nthe Third World Liberation Front strike\n, the formation of SF State’s Gay Liberation Front, the power of gay faculty labor activism, the police shooting of an SF State student at a downtown gay bar, protests of an airline that refused to board a student wearing a “Homosexuals for Peace” button, the hiring of an openly lesbian professor, conflicts between lesbians and trans people at a campus gay dance, and the development of the college’s first LGBTQ studies courses.\nPrior to the late 1960s, what was campus life for LGBTQ students at SF State?\nJudging by what we know about other colleges, there were probably many challenges — anti-LGBTQ messages in courses, cultural invisibility, social rejection, threats of suspension and expulsion. I think institutions such as SF State could do much more to acknowledge, take responsibility for and redress these ugly moments in their histories. But there likely were also love affairs, sexual encounters, intimate friendships, social networks and lessons about resistance, struggle and empowerment.\nThe only specific stories we’ve encountered about that period come from Richard Wallace Love (a.k.a. Richard Amory), a married veteran and father who wrote one of the best-selling gay novels of the 1960s (“Song of the Loon”) while doing his M.A. in Spanish at SF State in the early 1960s. In the early 1970s, Love came out as gay, joined the gay liberation movement and denounced the exploitative publishing contracts that he, along with many other gay writers of that era, had to sign in order to have their work published.\nIt’s also interesting that he claimed that what made it possible for him to write the novel, in secret, was that SF State provided him with a private office on campus. It’s a great story about how an SF State education, if accompanied by the right kinds of material support, can lead to impressive outcomes.\nHow has the SF State community had an impact on broader struggles for LGBTQ liberation?\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, LGBTQ struggles on and off campus were influenced and inspired by the Third World Liberation Front strike and other struggles against racism, sexism and colonialism. SF State faculty and students were local, regional and national leaders in gay liberation (Charles Thorpe), lesbian feminism (Sally Gearhart), gay literature (Richard Love) and gay/labor alliances (Morgan Pinney). Beyond the Bay Area, Berkeley and Stanford might be better known, but SF State was the city’s main public university, and San Francisco emerged as a center for LGBTQ liberation in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nLater, and I don’t know much about this history, SF State made groundbreaking faculty hires in LGBTQ studies, established LGBTQ-affirmative programs in Sexuality Studies and Women and Gender Studies, and facilitated LGBTQ studies research in the Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality and the National Sexuality Resource Center, which eventually combined to become the Center for Research and Education on Gender and Sexuality.\nToday in 2022, LGBTQ studies faculty at SF State are somewhat fragmented and scattered in multiple administrative units, including Cinema, Ethnic Studies, History, Sociology and Sexuality Studies, and Women and Gender Studies, and there’s more the institution could do to coordinate, promote and support our work, but I believe we have one of the largest and most impressive collections of LGBTQ studies faculty anywhere in the world.\nLearn more about the History Department at SF State\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "Tuesday, June 06, 2017\nSF STATE NEWS -- The free speech, the civil rights and the anti-war movements were all present on campus starting in the early 1960s, according to SF State Political Science Professor Robert Smith. The Summer of Love was just one of these movements — the drug use and free love were another way of expressing dissatisfaction with the predominant culture, he said. “There was a lot of cross-fertilization. People were going back and forth from one movement to another,” he said. “There was a confluence of different protest movements and they eventually moved into one mass protest against the Vietnam War.” SF State’s various protests very quickly became a model for other colleges and universities in California and eventually the rest of the country, Smith said. That was particularly true of the five-month student strike for ethnic studies and greater representation of minorities on campus in 1968 to 1969. “I remember coming up here when I was a student at Cal State Los Angeles to see how to organize,” he said. “It had kind of a ripple effect. San Francisco State students went to Brandeis to help them organize there for Black Studies.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "'We Are Here, We Have Always Been Here': SF State Produces First-Ever Documentary on Bay Area Iranian Community",
    "content": "Tuesday, November 27, 2018\nThe Nasiri family story may sound familiar. A young man, Steve Saeed Nasiri, moves from his native Iran to Berkeley for college, supports himself by working at restaurants and eventually becomes a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur and angel investor. But this American success story hasn’t been told yet. It will be soon, in a new film produced by San Francisco State’s Documentary Film Institute and Center for Iranian Diaspora Studies.\nWe Are Here, We Have Always Been Here\nis the first documentary to focus on the Bay Area’s Iranian community. The Nasiri Foundation recently contributed a $10,000 grant to the film.\n“Now more than ever, the Iranian American community is understanding the necessity of being more organized as a diaspora — to share our stories loudly, to be proud of where we came from and to vocalize all that we have contributed to our adopted country,” says Shanna Nasiri, fund manager for the Nasiri Foundation. “We need empathy, not just for the Iranian American community, but for immigrants at large.”\nWe Are Here\ndocuments the complex personal histories that have brought Iranians to the Bay Area for more than 70 years, spanning four generations.\nThe greater San Francisco area is home to the second largest Iranian population in California, and likely the second largest outside of Iran itself, says Persis Karim,\nWe Are Here\nco-director.\n“This is an evolving community that continues to shape the Bay Area through arts, culture and innovation,” says Karim, director of the Center for Iranian Diaspora Studies and a professor of Comparative and World Literature. “They continue to grapple with the historic trauma of leaving Iran under difficult circumstances.”\nUltimately, the film conveys the resilience and determination of this community, despite the political turmoil that has shadowed Iranian Americans for decades.\n“It isn’t easy to pick up and leave your place of birth, oftentimes on your own and away from your family,” Shanna Nasiri adds. “It takes a lot of drive and motivation, and I think the Iranian American community in the Bay Area is a phenomenal example of how those qualities can be channeled to make a significant and positive impact in the world.”\nSoumyaa K. Behrens, Documentary Film Institute director and Cinema lecturer, is the other co-director of\nWe Are Here\n. She says the film employs a personal aesthetic that focuses on how historic events in the Bay Area and Iran have affected the community.\n“The mosaic of personal and historical elements shows a picture of Iranians deeply rooted in the Bay Area,” she says.\nThe film will be completed in March 2020. Josh Peterson is consulting editor. Students will help with production, post-production and archival research.\n— Matt Itelson\nLinks\nNasiri Foundation\nDocumentary Film Institute\nCenter for Iranian Diaspora Studies\nPhoto: Soumyaa K.

    "content": "Tuesday, September 15, 2015\nSAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS -- “East Side Sushi” is as homegrown a production as the farmers market up the street. Not only was it filmed in Oakland where it flashes some of the city’s major attractions — the soothing beauty of Lake Merritt, the regalness of the Grand Lake Theatre, the cultural vitality of the Fruitvale district, to name a few — it was written and directed by an Oakland-born filmmaker who graduated from San Francisco State University. So that’s one angle to fuel interest in this uplifting drama about a Latina single mother’s evolving quest to become a sushi chef in a male-dominated profession. But also important to note are the numerous audience awards it has collected while on the festival circuit, including its world premiere at San Jose’s Cinequest in February. Either way, it would be a shame to miss this feel-good winner from Anthony Lucero, who in his feature-length debut, creates a signature dish that stacks up favorably with a flurry of other foodie films.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

San Francisco State University Professor David Lee said his students analyzed the city’s public meetings for a class project, and found them sparsely attended. “They found there are many meetings scheduled in the middle of the day in the middle of the work week, with very few students that looked like them,” Lee told the San Francisco Examiner. To foster more participation, Lee and his students authored the Sunshine and Open Government Act of 2015, Proposition E, which San Franciscans will be asked whether to approve Tuesday. Proposition E would require public meetings, testimony and comments to be accessible through electronic and prerecorded means, according to its ballot language. This means all meetings would need to be broadcast online, perhaps also for mobile phones.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Accreditation\nThis website has been designed to meet the requirements of accreditation for the Master of Science (M.S.)\neducation program in Speech Language Pathology\n{residential} at San Francisco State University, which is accredited by the\nCouncil on Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology\n(CAA) of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), 2200 Research Boulevard #310, Rockville, Maryland 20850, 800-498-2071 or 301-296-5700.\nThe current accreditation cycle by CAA is 2025 – 2033. Furthermore, the Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences (SLHS) credential program at San Francisco State is accredited by the\nCalifornia Commission on Teacher Credentialing\n(CCTC).\nThe speech-language pathology curriculum is designed to train competent, culturally sensitive speech-language pathologists who can appreciate and understand the importance of research in clinical practice. In order to accomplish this goal, a multitude of academic and clinical experiences are provided to the students under the direction of skilled instructors, clinical researchers and supervisors both on and off campus. The development of clinical skills requires academic knowledge, the ability to understand and engage in research and a sensitivity to clients' needs, values and cultures.\nThe SLHS department curriculum includes all academic and clinical experiences necessary for American Speech and Hearing Association (ASHA) certification in speech-language pathology, the State of California Speech-Language Pathology Services Credential (SLPSC) and the State of California license to practice speech-language pathology. Students are required to complete all academic courses. The practice of speech-language pathology in the state of California requires a license issued by the Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Examining Committee Medical Board of California. Exempted settings are public schools and federal facilities. The academic and clinical requirements for the state license are similar to those of ASHA requirements in speech-language pathology.\nThis website serves as a repository and information resource in which our program processes and evidence are organized for each of the six CAA Accreditation Standards.\nProgram Structure\nThe speech-language pathology curriculum is designed to train competent, culturally sensitive speech-language pathologists who can appreciate and understand the importance of research in clinical practice. To accomplish this goal, the students are provided with many academic and clinical experiences under the direction of skilled instructors, clinical researchers and supervisors both on and off campus. Developing clinical skills requires academic knowledge, understanding and engaging in research and sensitivity to clients' needs, values and cultures.\nOur curricula prepare students to meet the standards of American Speech and Hearing Association (ASHA) certification in speech-language pathology, California state licensure in speech-language pathology and the California Speech-Language Pathology Services Credential.\nA total of 35 units of academic courses are required for the Master of Science degree in speech-language pathology. Clinical practica totals six units. Internships totaling 14 units are based on the number of experiences necessary for the student to obtain the 375 clinical clock hours plus 25 observation hours required for ASHA certification and California state licensure. Students should plan to complete these requirements over a minimum of 5 full-time semesters, which includes a summer session. The program is delivered in a face-to-face/residential modality, with modifications available to students in internship placements located outside of the San Francisco Bay Area (during the second year of the program).\nStudents who wish to pursue a specialization may need to take up to 15 additional units, which will result in an additional one to two semesters of graduate work.\nMission\nThe mission of the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences (SLHS) at San Francisco State University is based on our commitment to antiracism and other forms of anti-discrimination as fundamental to our professions and essential to our preparation of professionals to:\nIdentify, challenge and dismantle institutional, environmental, sociocultural, informational, attitudinal and linguistic barriers to accessible, equitable and transformative communication for individuals with communication disabilities and those whose right of expression are diminished or silenced;\nDevelop, model, disseminate and adopt best practices in the provision of equitable, competent, compassionate and culturally/linguistically responsive services to individuals with communication disabilities across the lifespan and\nTo promote linguistic diversity and recognize the use of different languages and Englishes among our students and professionals as an asset to our academic and professional community.\nVision\nThe vision of the SLHS department at SF State is to be a leader in the field of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences for advancing critical thinking, equity and scientific rigor. We aspire to meet the challenges of creating pathways for recruiting, supporting, retaining and nurturing highly qualified students and professionals who represent diverse histories, identities, life experiences and perspectives. The SLHS administration, faculty, student body and professional partners represent a community of practice that respects and supports individuals with communication disabilities; that integrates research with clinical practice; that embodies equity; and that fosters an inclusive student/professional community in service of accessible communication for all.\nStrategic Initiatives\nStrategic initiative 1: Acquire, incorporate and develop university resources and address systemic inequities to support a growing department.\nStrategic initiative 2: Refine curriculum to reflect social justice, equity and anti-racism through evidence-based practice and cutting-edge clinical research.\nStrategic initiative 3: Meet the urgent need for diverse racial/ethnic, cultural, disability and socioeconomic representation in our student body and in the field at large, especially traditionally underrepresented and marginalized groups.\nStrategic initiative 4: Deepen the integration of technology into teaching, clinical work and research to support diversifying student body and access equity.\nImprovement Cycle\nIt is integral to the Mission, Vision and Strategic Initiatives of the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences (SLHS) at San Francisco State University to have cycles of evaluation embedded at key points throughout the academic year.\nThe evaluation process includes:\nA yearly evaluation process\nMultiple sources of data from all stakeholders\nKey student assignments embedded within clinical, academic and professional practice competencies\nTimely provision of student support\nOur improvement cycle is based on tools such as “Plan-Do-Study-Act.” More information about our continuous improvement process can be found on the\nData Kitchen\nwebsite.",

The latter recalls Mifune’s commanding presence  in “Seven Samurai,” by saying it “felt like he had been created by the forces of seismic activity.” Ironically, a young Mifune, who was adept at karate, archery and swordsmanship, had no intention of becoming an actor. He wanted to work behind the scenes as a camera assistant, but there was no keeping him out of the spotlight. He would go on to make 170 films.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

I think we’re seeing that now more than ever,” he says. “There’s a different dynamic in each state. The big question is, right now — how is this partisan divide going to show up in the election? Meaning who can get out, who can turn out the people further in their parties. It’s the question about turnout.”\nThe professor admits that the Americans are significantly polarized about the candidates: those who don't like Trump will vote for virtually any Democratic candidate; similarly, those who don't like Biden and Democrats will side with Trump despite all odds.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Facebook and Twitter are not only feeding our desires, but shaping them.\n“We sort of become programmed by the technology that was supposedly programmed for us,” Tuman said.\nThe more we eat the snackable content served up on social media, Tuman said, the more we crave it.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

It follows the quest of two Chinese American orphans, Sam and Lucy, to bury their father, a failed gold prospector. In this tender coming-of-age story, Zhang asks “what makes a home a home?” and in placing a Chinese family at its center, a group that history has not just forgotten, but in some instances, erased, the novel reshapes the American western.\nGuests include Zhang and May-Lee Chai, associate professor, Department of Creative Writing, San Francisco State University.

He said he learned a lot from taking a course with her.\n“I enjoy taking her class. … I learned from her to start using my critical thinking, and to describe the word’s and the sentence’s meanings more,” Ahmad said.\nOther students, like computer science major and junior Nima Bullock, said that Professor Luft gives them the opportunity to take chances in the classroom, which he feels is a very unique opportunity.\n“If I would describe Professor Luft in one word, I would say she is skeptical of everything, in a good way, in the idea that she doesn’t believe in one thing in particular. She is always open to our ideas and new ideas,” Bullock said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

I then worked in London on documentary arts series scripts.\n“My little toddler son began showing odd symptoms about this time. I didn’t have a clue what they meant. I asked a London child psychiatrist about what to do, and he said, ‘The question is not what to do for him, but where to put him.” Right then I knew I had to get out of London and get Timothy to a university. I knew we had to get him to University of California at San Francisco. There, when I was seven months pregnant, we got the diagnosis: autism.

    "title": "Jewish Food Fights: Students Get Appetite for Culinary Traditions",
    "content": "Thursday, May 09, 2019\nPhoto by Roger Habon\nThe Department of Jewish Studies has sanctioned food fights all semester long. No actual food has been reported to have been flung, however, in Rachel Gross’ Jewish Food Fights course, which explores the politics of religion, food and eating among Jews in America since the 19th century.\nIn this Q&A, Gross — the John and Marcia Goldman Professor of American Jewish Studies — dishes on how students can learn about cultural traditions through cuisine.\nWhat gave you the idea for the course?\nYou are what you eat, as the saying goes. Studying what people eat and how they talk about food is a great way to learn about their lives and how they think about themselves and others. I’m a religious studies professor who studies American Jews, and American Jews have thought carefully about how what they eat makes them different from and similar to other Americans since the colonial period.\nProfessors at other universities have offered classes on studying religion through food, but I was one of the first to offer a course that traced American Jewish history through food studies. We go from how colonial Jewish merchants connected Jews in the Americas and Europe through transporting and selling food all the way to Urban Adamah, the Jewish farm in Berkeley, and Covenant Winery, the kosher winery in Berkeley. We’re taking a field trip to both of those places in May!\nHow often do you teach it?\nThis is my third year at SF State, and so far I’ve offered it once a year, in the spring.\nHow have students responded to the course?\nLike all of our Jewish Studies courses, it’s attracted a wide range of students from all backgrounds. The course is designed to help students analyze the world around them, whether or not they’re Jewish. For me, the most exciting moments in the class are the material we study, helping students think about their own lives, their families and their communities. The role that food plays in their lives and the way it defines them and their communities.\nI also love studying primary sources with students — when we can laugh about the ridiculous things people included in early 20th-century cookbooks but also think carefully about what it tells us about the people who made those cookbooks and how they might have used them.\nI also really like thinking about really ordinary things with students, and asking what they tell us about the people who make and use (or eat) them. Today we talked about what the history of bagels tells us about American Jews. It’s such an ordinary item that we might overlook it in our day-to-day lives, but thinking about the way it moved from a specifically Jewish food item in the early 20th century to one eaten every day by many Americans today helps us think about the place of Jews in the United States and the way they’ve influenced American culture more broadly.\nCan you let us know some of the visiting scholars and more about food journalist Alix Wall’s work and how it benefited your students?\nAlix Wall spoke as part of the department’s #JewishStudiesAnd series and in conjunction with my course. The series is designed to introduce students to a wide variety of professions in which they can use the skills they learn as a Jewish Studies or other humanities major.\nIn the American Jewish food course, Alix’s writing about Jewish food, especially but not only her writing in the J. newspaper is a primary source through which we can learn about Jews and food in the Bay Area. But having her speak helped students learn how she does her research and reporting. Students are required to write a paper as a newspaper article on a local site of Jewish food, and I explicitly point to Alix’s writing as a model for them.\nHaving her speak about her Jewish food writing also demonstrated that our course subject matters to people in our community, beyond the classroom. We aren’t studying this topic in isolation.\nAny thoughts about how the Jewish Studies program can benefit a prospective student applying to SF State?\nThe Department of Jewish Studies is devoted to the study of the history, culture, religion, politics and literature of the Jewish people. We’re a small, warm department of faculty members who deeply care about our students, so they don’t get lost in the shuffle of a big school. Our majors, minors and other students in our courses are from all and no religious backgrounds.\nTo me, studying Jews is just a way of studying people in general, and our faculty members introduce students to history, politics, film studies, pop culture studies, comparative literature and religious studies. For me, the most interesting thing to do in life is to learn about what’s meaningful to people and why those things matter to them. My courses help students questions about what’s been meaningful to American Jews as a way of asking questions about how people make meaning — including how my students do so in their own lives.\n— Ufuoma Umusu\nLinks\nFood Fights: The Politics of American Jewish Consumption from 1654 to the Present\nNostalgia is Key Ingredient in Your Pastrami on Rye, says SFSU professor, J., April 27, 2017\nRachel Gross\nNews Article",

    "content": "EXCO Past Courses Fall 2022\n___________________________________________________________________\nCritical Character Study within Anime\nThis class would be a critical character study of Anime characters throughout various genres of anime. There are very interesting and deep meanings behind characters, from their ideologies, symbolism, and real world inspiration of philosophers. In this class, I would go week by week dissecting these various characters for analysis and to prompt discussions on what these characters truly represent. We would go over philosophy, symbolism, story arcs, relations with real world people, and overall discussions of the anime.\n___________________________________________________________________\nWriting on the Muni\nWrite poetry with creative writing junior Adrian Jose Fernandez, traveling to different locations around San Francisco each class. Learn about the history of our city by actually visiting important locations while also writing poetry on and about what you see. The original Philz, balmy alley, Views of Alcatraz, ocean beach bonfires, the Castro, Haight and Ashbury. Practice writing poetry in an outdoor, group setting in the most evocative city in all of California.\n___________________________________________________________________\nPeace and equality of men and women and the Baha'i Faith\nThis class will introduce students to the Baha'i faith and its principles and its aim for world peace and equality of men and women.\n___________________________________________________________________\nGenealogy - the study and tracing of lines of descent or development\nThis course will be giving students the opportunity to exercise their free will and their freedom to choose. This Genealogy course will help guide students with the process of acquiring insight into one's own character and the understanding of oneself or one's own motives or character. The college experience is to build and strengthen character.\n___________________________________________________________________\nCritical Analysis of Contemporary Cinematic Expression\n\"Critical Analysis of Contemporary Cinematic Expression” is a film course where we will analyze movies from a span of genres. From foreign to musical to independent and B-Movie, we will be viewing movies that touch on social and interpersonal issues of the human experience. This class will be designed to be inclusive and recognize and appreciate all walks of life while being considerate and acknowledging the different lifestyles and belief systems that we may share. While some movies share similar themes, many of them will focus on specific themes that will be discussed as a class after the viewing. Some categories and titles we may start with are Foreign: Portrait of A Lady on Fire (2019) (French); Musical: Cats Don’t Dance (1997); and Psychological: Swallow (2019).\n___________________________________________________________________\nSleep Health and Hygiene\nAs college students, we struggle so much with balancing work, school and our personal lives that oftentimes we forget about the importance of sleep and we tend to experience sleep deprivation. Through this course we will discuss the importance of sleep hygiene, the anatomy of sleep, sleeping disorders and dreaming. We will also use our five senses to explore the best methods to have a healthier sleeping schedule. Additionally, we will explore sleep as a form of self-care and we will practice many techniques that will help us balance our lives and sleep.\n___________________________________________________________________\nPhilosophy and Star Wars\nHave you ever wondered if you would be a Jedi or a Sith? Or whether Darth Vader was destined to become evil? Ever made real life references to Star Wars? This course is for you. The goals of this course are to introduce topics in Philosophy by using Star Wars as the anchor to make deep abstract thought more accessible and relatable in a clearway. From Ethics to Metaphysics to Eastern Philosophy students will ponder the philosophical aspects of Star Wars through thought provoking readings and engaging discussions.\n___________________________________________________________________\nExamining Selected African American Short Stories and Poems\nThis course will explore a few aspects of black literature. This will range readings that deal with black womanhood, religion in black literature, and the idea of \"passing\" in black culture. Through this class students are expected to read the assigned readings for each author, but they are also encouraged to read any other short stories/poems that they may come across during their time in the course. This course offers students a chance to look at the literature of authors they might not have read from before, as well as have an open space to discuss the themes/ideas that they felt were conveyed throughout the readings.\n___________________________________________________________________\nBDSM 101\nBDSM 101 will help students explore their personalities and sexuality in a safe, controlled space. We will dive into the deepest, darkest corners of the BDSM lifestyle and speak with people who have 60+ years of experience within the community. This class will push students to the edge of their comfort zone and encourage them to reevaluate what their boundaries truly are.\n___________________________________________________________________\nSFSU Pre-Med Course\nThis course will help serve as a guide for all the Pre-med students who are interested in pursuing a career in medicine, specifically going to medical school and becoming a doctor. It will give students an insight into the the different specialties in medicine. Students will learn about the life of doctors, nurses, PAs and what their daily routine looks like in a typical day, as well as explore various social issues in the field.\n___________________________________________________________________\nBasic Music Theory\nThough basic, this course delves into advanced concepts such as diatonic harmony--which is a fancy way of saying a group of chords which relate to a specific key. Learning how to achieve the ability to build diatonic harmony is lined out in a step-by-step process of memorizing the 12 tones of Western music and the Major Scale formula. From there, we will venture into chord construction, intervalic relationships, as well as complete small exercises which strengthen and reinforce our knowledge.\n___________________________________________________________________\nLucid Dreaming\nThis course is designed to facilitate understanding of the benefits of Lucid Dreaming while exploring mindful approaches to sleep and dreaming. We take a look at the history and science of Lucid Dreaming and talk about, and practice, a variety of effective induction techniques. We will be learning how to take note of our sleep cycles so that we can identify the most favorable times in the night to attempt lucid dreaming induction. We will be incorporating mindfulness and meditation to help our lucid dreaming training. Students will be able to identify the difference between lucid and non-lucid dreaming, understand how mindfulness helps both nighttime and daytime lucidity, and how to practice lucid dreaming safely, and without sacrificing their restorative sleep. At the end of the course, students will be able to create their own personalized lucid dreaming training program.\n___________________________________________________________________\nAdventures in San Francisco\nSan Francisco has a lot of little-known places. We will explore many of them in this course. Impress your friends with this knowledge.\n___________________________________________________________________\nIntroduction to New Queer Cinema\nThis course will give a broad overview of New Queer Cinema (NQC)—1990s independent queer film. We will discuss the social and political contexts from which the genre emerged (the AIDS epidemic, Reagan’s administration), seminal films, NQC in international contexts, and the influence of NQC on contemporary queer film. The course will include films by key NQC filmmakers Cheryl Dunye, Gregg Araki, Gus Van Sant, and others.\n___________________________________________________________________\n[Writer's Workshop]\nThis course will develop my own writing through helping others develop theirs. I also hope to foster a comfortable environment that will help students have an easier time with sharing their work in class.\n___________________________________________________________________",

Among Youth Speaks’ alumni are West Oakland poet and playwright Chinaka Hodge, who is developing a television series with “Creed” and “Fruitvale Station” writer-director Ryan Coogler, and her close friend Daveed Diggs, who stars on Broadway in the hip-hop musical “Hamilton.” “Daveed would win every time,” Hodge says of their Berkeley High slams. “But it was never really about that. It was always about the community, and having a place where I could be heard and seen.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Alumni Leslie Hughes and Karla Yates Reyff inspire each other to give to SF State\nSan Francisco Soul Sisters\nAbove L to R: Teenage Karla Yates Reyff and Leslie Hughes\nBy Gail Mallimson, University Development\nLeslie Hughes’ and Karla Yates Reyff’s paths intertwined in life in so many ways, it seems they were destined to be friends. The two first met decades ago, in Mrs. Pera’s kindergarten class at St. Vincent de Paul School in San Francisco’s Marina District and were friends through elementary and middle school. After that they lost touch, but over the years they ran into each other in San Francisco and resumed their friendship, which is now tight and steadfast.\nSurprisingly, Leslie and Karla did not meet while attending their alma mater, SF State, because they were there many years apart. Despite this, they have inspired each other to become devoted donors to the University, especially to the Guardian Scholars Program (GSP), which supports former and current foster youth in their educational journeys at the University. Leslie and Karla are now united in their commitment to help foster students who lack a solid support system to graduate and succeed.\nAfter grade school, Leslie attended Lowell High School and then SF State, where she studied Spanish, English, and education – subjects that she was passionate about. She earned a B.A. in 1966 and a Standard Secondary Credential in 1967, which launched her career as a teacher. She taught in San Francisco public schools for 42 years until she retired in 2009. Leslie still lives in San Francisco, just a couple of miles away from the neighborhood she grew up in.\nKarla attended San Jose State University and Indiana University of Pennsylvania after high school but left before receiving a degree from either institution. Eventually, she got divorced and returned to San Francisco with her young son Blaise in tow. As a single mom, her experience at SF State was focused on practicality and expediency, but she knows that the degree she received allowed her to pursue a rewarding career at the U.S. Department of Industrial Relations. “It was a really good job,” says Karla. “And I got the ticket from San Francisco State.”\nAbove L to R: Teenage Leslie Hughes & Karla Yates Reyff\nBoth women made lifelong friends at SF State, and Karla enjoyed an added benefit from her time there. After she retired in 1996, she searched for the opportunity to try something new. A credential she received from a night class in adult education at SF State more than 40 years before allowed her to start a second career in substitute teaching, which she enjoyed and found fulfilling.\nLeslie kept an affiliation with SF State and some faculty members whom she studied with. When she sat down with a lawyer to create an estate trust about 20 years ago, she decided to make a large planned gift to the University. Her development officer introduced her to the Guardian Scholars Program, which impressed her so much that she also became an annual donor.\nWhen Karla’s mother passed away, she inherited some money and started to look for a place to donate her required IRA distribution. Leslie suggested the Guardian Scholars Program to Karla and she immediately fell in love with the program. She has given annually to GSP for several years and has also made a large bequest in her will.\nWhile Karla and Leslie’s legacies will live on at the University through their generous giving and their lasting friendship, they have also passed the baton to Karla’s son Blaise, whom she raised while she was a student at SF State. Blaise graduated with a B.A. in History from SF State in 2004 and is now a high school history teacher at a private high school in San Francisco. “He’s pretty proud of graduating from SF State,” says Karla. “I always told him that he needed a degree for a career, and he loves his job now. So that’s another reason to be grateful to SF State.” “We’ve both gotten so much from the University,” says Leslie. “It feels good to pay it forward.”\nPictured at right:\nLeslie Hughes & Karla Yates Reyff today\nDonate to the Guardian Scholars Program\nFor more information about the Guardian Scholars Program, contact:\nAnjali Billa\n(\nShe/Her/Hers\n)\nAssociate Vice President\nUniversity Development\nanjalibilla@sfsu.edu\n(415) 405-3625\nRead more about Anjali\nRelated News\nSFSU School of Design Students Take Climate Innovation to Global Stage\nSeptember 30, 2025\nAngela Tafur, First Kirkeberg Scholar, Leads with Purpose\nSeptember 30, 2025\nKenneth S.

This marks the University’s first appearance in the list’s four-year history alongside the usual suspects like University of Southern California and the American Film Institute. Ranked at a respectable number 23, SF State earned major kudos for producing multiple Oscar nominees — 15 years straight — in various fields, including screenwriter Steve Zaillian (“Schindler’s List”) and producer Jonas Rivera (“Up”). While those accolades point to an enviable success in the mainstream, the Cinema Department at SF State primarily views itself as an innovative independent film school where students are taught to embrace the experimental and avant-garde and develop a keen knowledge of animation, documentaries and critical thought, says Daniel Bernardi, interim dean of the College of Liberal & Creative Arts.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Social work student earns top CSU award, says ‘education radically transformed’ his life\nAuthor:\nKent Bravo\nSeptember 23, 2024\nJuan Carlos Arredondo (B.A.. ’24) returns to SFSU, pursues graduate degree to advance career in supporting migrant communities\nJuan Carlos Arredondo faced challenges that profoundly disrupted his life. His father passed away when Arredondo was young, he had to navigate the United States education system as a child with very little guidance and he dropped in and out of college while pursuing an associate’s degree.\nDespite these challenges, Arredondo persevered and turned his life around. Last spring he earned a bachelor’s degree in Social Work from San Francisco State University, graduating with a 4.0 grade-point average. He returned to San Francisco State this fall to pursue a master’s degree in Social Work. On top of that, he recently earned one of the most prestigious student accolades.\nThe California State University (CSU) has awarded Arredondo the\nTrustees’ Award for Outstanding Achievement\n, the highest recognition of student achievement granted by the CSU. Each award provides a donor-funded scholarship to students who demonstrate superior academic performance, personal accomplishments, community service and inspirational goals for the future. The awardees have demonstrated a deep commitment to making a positive impact on their generation, as well as those who come after them.\n“Mr. Arredondo is an extraordinary person as well as a promising future professional who deserves the support provided by this award,” SF State President Lynn Mahoney said. “He possesses qualities of character, determination and personal excellence that’ll help him reach his goals and better our communities.\"\nArredondo was born in the U.S., relocated to Mexico due to his father’s death and eventually moved back to the U.S. When he returned, he spent all of his time outside of school helping with food preparation for his mother’s food truck that catered to agricultural workers. While this experience shaped his strong worth ethic, it also took away his focus on school at times and prevented him from joining extracurricular activities.\nAfter a decade of financially insecure and high-pressure work, Arredondo committed to pursuing an undergraduate degree. At that time, he had learned about an agency at the U.S./Mexico border that provides counseling to migrants who are incarcerated and separated from their families. That’s when his dream of becoming a social worker came into focus. “I want to be a role model and catalyst for change and embody the representation and services that were not available during my youth,” he said.\nWhile at SFSU, Arredondo worked hard toward his dream. He led a qualitative study that highlighted the voices of the unhoused population in San Francisco’s Tenderloin District and presented the findings at the 2024 Social Work Social Development Joint World Conference.\nArredondo also won the highly competitive\nWillie L. Brown , Jr. Fellowship\n, which landed him an internship with San Francisco’s Human Services Agency. There he helped connect emancipated foster youth to a guaranteed-income pilot program, shadowed social workers in the family maintenance and family reunification department and assisted with biopsychosocial assessments.\n“Education radically transformed my life,” Arredondo said. “It has not only given me meaning and hope for the future, but it is also healing old wounds. It has made me aware that I have always been capable.”\nArredondo is also involved in helping the communities he deeply cares for. For example, he interns at Manzanita SEED Elementary School, where he provides bilingual behavioral therapy in Spanish and English.\n“It is with tremendous joy and great pride that I celebrate the outstanding achievements and extraordinary perseverance of this year’s Trustees’ Scholars,” said CSU Chancellor Mildred García. “Through the visionary generosity of our donors, the CSU is able to uplift and support these diverse students and truly outstanding scholars who have overcome educational and personal hardships in pursuit of a college degree that will not only transform their lives, but will also elevate their families and strengthen their communities.”\nAre you passionate about social work and supporting marginalized communities?\nLearn more about how SF State’s School of Social Work can help you make a difference\n.\nTags\nCalifornia State University\nAwards and Achievements\nCollege of Health & Social Sciences\nSocial Work\nRelated News\nDiscover 2025: See what makes life brighter at SFSU on Oct. 18\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU offers full scholarships for first-of-its-kind PK-12 certificate in climate justice education\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025",

    "content": "Friday, March 22, 2019\nMOTHER JONES -- “I’m surprised the candidates have come to understand the case so quickly,” says Belkin, a political science professor at San Francisco State University. “I thought it would take a few more months to persuade them.”\nThis isn’t Belkin’s first longshot crusade. For 10 years, he advocated for the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, founding a nonprofit to conduct research and craft messaging to persuade lawmakers, the public, and even the generals that allowing gay troops to serve openly would not harm military readiness. For Pack the Courts, Belkin hired Sean McElwee, a 26-year-old social media whiz who helped popularized the idea of abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to do polling and research. Belkin recognized that the best way to introduce bold reform is in a crowded Democratic primary, with candidates eager to attract media attention and win over the party’s liberal base.\n“The emergencies we are facing are so extreme that if you are going to run for president, it’s not enough to have policy ideas,” he says. “You have to explain how you are going to pass those ideas and then how you are going to protect those ideas from the courts.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Professors’ book addresses role of prejudice in plight of ride-hail drivers\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nApril 12, 2022\nPhoto Credit:\nProfessors’ book addresses role of prejudice in plight of ride-hail drivers\nRace and gender are major factors why taxi and ride-hail drivers are ‘Spent Behind the Wheel,’ write Women and Gender Studies Professors Julietta Hua and Kasturi Ray\nRide-hail drivers face many of the same problems that have existed since the invention of the automobile, according to a new book by two Women and Gender Studies professors from San Francisco State University. While drivers’ struggles to make a living wage have generated much fanfare and legislation in the last decade, age-old stereotypes also dominate the occupation of those who drive passengers from one place to another.\nJulietta Hua and Kasturi Ray wrote\n“Spent Behind the Wheel: Drivers’ Labor in the Uber Economy”\n(University of Minnesota Press) after observing a correlation between the boom of the tech industry and the growing wealth inequality in the Bay Area following the 2007 – 2008 financial crisis. SF State’s Office of Research and Sponsored Programs and George and Judy Marcus Funds provided grants to support the book.\n“We have seen, to our dismay, the growth of\ngig workers\nbeing drawn from populations that are historically marginalized,” Ray said. “The work conditions under the new gig economy were not that new after all. It is something that racialized men have experienced in the U.S. throughout history.”\nDeeply rooted stereotypes persist about the danger of the immigrant male driver transporting other people, they found.\n“A city council person actually characterized taxi drivers as potentially raping your wives and daughters,” Hua said. “In the labor world, I don’t think people have necessarily thought about how the gendering of drivers is an important component of keeping drivers in low-wage situations.”\nDrivers and judges both pointed out to Hua and Ray that non-white gig workers receive an exorbitant amount of parking tickets and traffic violations.\nThe difficulty of using the bathroom has been linked to high rates of cancer and other diseases among taxi drivers, a Columbia University study found. Businesses are more likely to deny men of color the use of public restrooms, Hua and Ray said.\n“They’re racialized back into the servant class, where you’re not supposed to have a body; you’re just supposed to drive and meet your fill,” Ray said. “In that way, gender, race, nationality, class and privilege are seen so clearly in the health risks that taxi drivers are taking for us every day.”\nHua and Ray researched the book through firsthand interviews with drivers, labor organizers and members of licensing commissions. They also pored over case law, scholarly publications, social media posts, public meetings from municipal taxi commissions and media coverage. They spent a great deal of time with the New York Taxi Workers Alliance and spoke to former Uber, Lyft and cab drivers in the Bay Area.\nTheir analysis is based on a feminist perspective, and their scholarly interest in labor. Combining their respective expertise in sex work and domestic work, they define taxi and ride-hail drivers as “reproductive laborers.” In other words, the job involves attending to another person’s needs and wants, similar to a housekeeper or nanny. Unlike most other “reproductive labor” jobs that have been “feminized,” professional passenger drivers have traditionally been men of color, predominately immigrants.\nThese nuanced issues are something to be mindful of when getting a ride.\n“Understand you are in someone’s workplace and very well might be their home,” Ray said. “Make your expectations in accordance with workers’ lives. Support drivers’ fights for dignity because it affects you.”\nHua added: “This is really about not taking for granted and fairly compensating people’s labor. Support minimum wage laws — like the Fight for $15 to raise the national minimum wage — and other efforts that try to raise the working conditions of all people.”\nLearn more about the\nWomen and Gender Studies Department at SF State\n.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "General Education Fall 2025 and Beyond\nGeneral Education Course Expectations and Learning Outcomes\nSF State Studies Course Expectations and Learning Outcomes\nAmerican Institutions Course Expectations and Learning Outcomes\nWhat changes were made to General Education (GE) and why?\nThe GE program was revised across the CSU system to reduce the number of GE units from 48 to 43, effective fall 25. This change was made to align the freshman admit GE pattern with the  Cal-GETC transfer student pathway. Cal-GETC defines the lower-division GE requirements for students at community colleges for either the CSU or the UC system.\nAt the lower-division, the GE requirement for life-long learning and development (area E) was removed from GE, and the requirement in Arts and Humanities (C1 and C2) was reduced from 9 units at the lower-division to 6 units. Students will still take one course in the Arts and one course in the Humanities. The lower-division Physical and Biology Life Sciences requirement was changed from a 6 - 7 unit requirement to a 7 unit requirement.\nAt the upper-division, students still take one course in Arts and Humanities, one course in Behavioral and Social Sciences and one course in either Physical/ Biological Sciences or Mathematical Concepts/Quantitative Reasoning.\nAdditionally, the course learning outcomes for GE and SF State Studies were changed for SFSU courses. The learning outcomes are not mandated by the CSU but are designed by SFSU faculty. Requests to have courses meet GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions requirements must address how learning outcomes are taught and assessed in the course.\nWhat are the new GE areas and labels?\nAll of the GE labels and many of the area names were changed. The table below summarizes the changes:\nCurrent GE Areas and Labels\nNew GE Areas and Labels Effective Fall 25\nRequirements Effective Fall 25\nA1: Oral Communication\n1C: Oral Communication\n1 course, 3 units\nA2: Written English Communication\n1A: English Composition\n1 course, 3 units\nA3: Critical Thinking\n1B: Critical Thinking\n1 course, 3 units\nB1: Physical Science\n5A: Physical Science\n1 course, 3 units\nB2: Life Science\n5B: Biological Science\n1 course, 3 units\nB3: Laboratory Science\n5C: Laboratory (see note below)\n1 course, 1 unit\nB4: Quantitative Reasoning\n2: Mathematical Concepts and Quantitative Reasoning\n1 course, 3 units\nC1: Arts\n3A: Arts\n1 course, 3 units\nC2: Humanities\n3B: Humanities\n1 course, 3 units\nC1 Arts or C2 Humanities\n-\nRemoved from GE\nD1: Social Sciences\nD2: US History\n4: Social and Behavioral Sciences (see note below)\n2 courses, 6 units\nE: Lifelong Learning and Development\n-\nRemoved from GE\nF: Ethnic Studies\n6: Ethnic Studies\n1 course, 3 units\nUD-B: Upper-Division Physical and/or Life Sciences\n2UD: Upper-division Mathematical Concepts/Quantitative Reasoning\nor\n5UD: Upper-division Science\n1 course, 3 units\nUD-C: Upper-Division Arts and/or Humanities\n3UD: Upper-division Arts or Humanities\n1 course, 3 units\nUD-D: Upper-Division Social Sciences\n4UD: Upper-Division Social and Behavioral Sciences\n1 course, 3 units\nArea 5C note: Area 5C courses must be associated with an area 5A or 5B lecture. The lab can either be a standalone 1 unit course with a 5A or 5B lecture pre- or co-requisite, or the lab and lecture can be a single 4 unit course (3 units lecture, 1 unit laboratory).\nArea 4 Note: Students must take area 4 courses from at least two different departments or with two different subjects. Students admitted as freshmen will take one lower division area 4 course that also meets the US History requirement.\nWhat’s the impact of these GE changes on continuing students?\nContinuing students will see GE and SF State Studies areas in their degree progress reports (DPRs) with the pre-fall 2025 areas and labels. They will continue to be able to search for courses in the online class schedule using old labels and see lists of courses in the degree planner under the those labels. They should consult the front page of their degree progress report to view their GE bulletin year. In addition to using the online class schedule search, they can also reference the bulletin to find courses that meet GE for their bulletin year.\nWith the removal of area E from GE and the reduction of area C from three courses to two, some continuing students received a waiver for those requirements effective fall 25. Specifically, any active student in spring 25 who had not completed an area E course and who was not enrolled in an area E course in spring 25 had that requirement waived in their DPR. Similarly, a third area C course was waived for some continuing students to effectively limit the area C requirement to one C1 course and one C2 course. Students who have completed two or more courses in just one area of C did not receive a waiver because they still need to complete one course in the other area of C. Students who receive a waiver will see a note about it in the GE area in their DPR.\nWhy were GE and SF State Studies learning outcomes changed at SFSU?\nWith the change in the GE labels, this seemed like a good time to evaluate the certification and recertification work that has been going on since the last revisions to GE in 2014. One area of concern was the very long review time needed to get a course certified in GE. The faculty committee doing these reviews found the learning outcomes put in place in 2014 to be complicated, unclear, and, in some cases, not assessable. This made it difficult for proposers to know how to respond to prompts and for reviewers to evaluate their responses, resulting in slow reviews and multiple requests for revisions.\nThe learning outcomes were revised to be reduced in number and to use assessable language to describe the student learning expected. Faculty proposing a course for GE must explain in the proposal how the course aligns with the expected outcomes within the context of the discipline being taught.\nLearning outcomes were revised for each GE area and the four SF State Studies areas.\nI already have a GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions course. Do I need to do anything in response to the changes in GE?\nAll courses already in GE remain in the same area, although the GE labels will change in the bulletin, course catalog, and class schedule effective fall 25. For example, if you have a C1 Arts course, it will now be a 3A Arts course. The old designations are kept in the background so that the course will satisfy C1 for continuing students and 3A for new students entering in fall 2025 and beyond.\nYou need to update course syllabi with the new GE and SF State Studies labels, names, and learning outcomes. Additionally, you may need to realign your course to meet the new outcomes. Please have this updated starting with the fall 25 semester.\nIf you have any information on department or school websites that reference GE courses or areas, those also need to be updated with the new GE labels and names. Likewise, plan to update any advising information that reference GE for incoming fall 2025 students. Older materials for continuing students can reference the old GE labels.\nCourses in GE are periodically assessed for recertification. At that point, the department offering the course must show how it aligns with the revised learning outcomes and how well students are learning those outcomes to remain certified in the area of GE. Recertification is done by the Baccalaureate Requirements Assessment Committee (BRAC), a Senate committee with faculty representatives from colleges.\nI have a course being reviewed for GE with the current learning outcomes. Do I need to start the proposal over?\nNo. Courses that are already submitted or being reviewed for GE or SF State Studies will be evaluated against the pre-fall 2025 outcomes with the original proposal, but will receive the new GE label when approved by the committee. However, please align the course with the new learning outcomes when you begin teaching it. The course will be recertified in the future against the new learning outcomes.\nI want to propose a course for GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions for the first time. How do I do that?\nRequests to certify a course for GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions are proposed in the course record in CourseLeaf and reviewed by the Baccalaureate Requirements Certification Committee (BRCC), with faculty representatives from each college.\nThere are expectations associated with each GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions course. You’ll find these expectations on the Course Expectations and Learning Outcomes page. Please read them and design the course with these expectations in mind.\nIn the course record, you will be asked to respond to three prompts for each learning outcome. Answers to these prompts should closely align with the learning outcome; the more focused and specific the answers, the easier it will be for BRCC to determine that the course will fulfill the learning outcome.\nThe prompts focus on the materials you will use to teach the learning outcome, the activities students will do to develop skills or understanding associated with the learning outcome, and the student work and approach you will use to assess student learning of the outcome.\nFor each learning outcome, you will be asked to respond to these three prompts:\nIn several sentences, please explain how you as an instructor will provide the foundational knowledge and skills that align with the goals of this SLO.\nWhat materials (e.g., readings, lectures, movies, presentations, laboratories, performance techniques) will you provide to students so that they can meet this SLO?\nDo not replicate your syllabus here, but only include materials directly aligned to the SLO in the appropriate part of the proposal.\nWhat specific activities will the students engage in so that they can build the skills or understanding that will allow them to meet this SLO?\nThese might include reflections, discussions, essays, short writing pieces, quizzes, projects, blog posts, laboratory experiments, performances, presentations.\nBe sure to describe at least one activity and how it aligns with the specific learning outcome.\nDescribe the graded assignment(s) or student work that you will use to assess how well students have met the learning outcome.\nBe sure to explain how the student work maps to the learning outcome and demonstrates that students have met its goals.\nPlease include at least one example of a prompt or question that you would ask the students to respond to.\nWe do not need your entire assignment instruction sheet or grading rubric, just the section(s) that specifically align with the learning outcome.\nIndicate how much all graded assignment(s)/activities aligned with the SLO will count towards the final grade.\nWhat are my obligations to have a course meet GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions requirements?\nTwo major obligations must be met for courses that meet GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions requirements. The syllabus must include information about these requirements, and the department must assess student learning in the course when requested as part of the recertification process.\nSyllabus Requirements\nCourses approved in an area of GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions must include in the course syllabus:\nThe area of general education, SF State Studies, or American Institutions that the course fulfills, i.e. This course satisfies General Education Area 3UD Arts and Humanities and Global Perspectives for SF State Studies.\nThe university-approved student learning outcomes (SLOs) for each of the areas fulfilled by the course (see learning outcomes section)\nThe activities and/or assignments the students complete to demonstrate they have met the SLOs.\nIt is the responsibility of the department, school, college, or program that offers the course to ensure that instructors of the course are aware of the GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions areas fulfilled by the course and that the syllabus reflects this information.\nThank you for communicating to students what they can expect to learn in your course!\nParticipation in student learning assessment for recertification:\nOnce a course has been approved for GE, SF State Studies, or American Institutions, it will undergo periodic recertification. The standard interval between reviews is five years. The department, school, college, or program that offers the course is responsible for conducting the assessment and submitting the requested recertification report.\nCalls for recertification will be announced in the spring semester, and departments will engage in that work during the following academic year. Please be aware that anonymous examples of student work may be requested as evidence that learning outcomes are being met. If no report is received for a course, it will no longer satisfy the requirement being recertified.  The department may decide to request certification for the course at a future date as a new request.\nActive scheduling required for GE courses:\nThere is an expectation that courses in GE are offered on a frequent basis for student planning. Courses approved for GE that have not been offered within a five-year period shall have their GE status removed and the course will be deactivated. The department may decide to reactivate the course and request certification at a future date as a new request.\nSubstantive Course Revisions:\nAny course that undergoes substantial revision to titles or descriptions requires reevaluation to retain an existing area of GE.",

Stephen Petersen, a 27-year-old Alameda folk musician and recent San Francisco State grad, said he has no ill will toward the city and that police were simply “trying to do their jobs.” The September 28 fires — eight in all set to trash bins and apartment buildings — ripped through Alameda’s Park Street business district, causing an estimated $3 million in damage. It was the largest such incident in Alameda in at least 20 years, according to Alameda police Lieutenant Jill Ottaviano.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, June 25, 2019\nBAY AREA REPORTER -- As the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion approaches, long considered the birth of the modern gay rights movement, people may think that they know what transpired and why it was so important. However, Marc Stein, professor of History at San Francisco State University, is convinced there is not one paradigm, but many conflicting experiences with multiple interpretations that color our understanding of this LGBTQ origin story. Attempting to reclaim the Stonewall story for queer people on their own terms, Stein, a gay man, has collected 200 documents (many not easy to access) drawing from both primary and secondary sources that include mainstream, alternative and LGBTQ media, covering the period 1965 to 1973, in his new book, “The Stonewall Riots: A Documentary History” (NYU Press). “There were multiple inspirations. I continue to be inspired by LGBT activism in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the decades before I came out and became an activist myself in the 1980s,” Stein says. “I wanted to encourage others to be similarly inspired, without losing sight of the importance of constructive criticism. I also knew that the 50th anniversary celebrations would create teachable moments — opportunities to revisit the Stonewall era and reconsider the developments that preceded and followed the riots.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Alum Annette Bening returns to Little Theatre for talk with students",
    "content": "Tuesday, October 21, 2014\nCourtesy of Geffen Playhouse\nVeteran movie star Annette Bening gave an inspiring talk on acting and the arts in a familiar place — the Little Theatre — on October 10.\n“So many things are running through my mind right now. I’m kind of emotional to tell you the truth, because I spent a lot of time in this theatre,” she said. “.... I wanted to first say that the reason I feel kind of emotional coming here is because I was you.”\nBening is an alumna of the Theatre Arts Department, class of 1980, and remembers her time fondly. During the talk, the four-time Academy Award nominee recounted a lecture she herself had attended as a student, when the late American Conservatory Theatre founder Bill Ball spoke. Ball was later to become her mentor at ACT, where she launched her acting career.\nLaura Wayth, an actress and assistant professor of Theatre Arts, interviewed Bening. The session included a Q&A with students as well. During the conversation Bening addressed various topics with aplomb, including tips on auditioning and thoughts on her personal process, often standing up and walking around the stage to demonstrate techniques.\nShe implored students to keep a positive attitude and always have a strong belief in their acting.\n“Doubt is something you just never get rid of, so don’t even try. Just stop right now,” Bening said. “Insecurity, you’ll always have it. So in a way, I’m saying that to reassure you and to encourage you, not to discourage you.”\nShe also suggested how students can talk to parents who might not approve of a future career in the arts. “You tell them, ‘I understand you have my best interest at heart, but I’m going toward this path,’” she said.\nBening, who has four children with her husband, actor/director Warren Beatty, also discussed the ways in which her career has changed since starting a family, stating that she often decides on projects based on whether or not film fits into her family’s schedule. The filming location of her most recent film\nThe Kids are All Right\n, was changed from New York to Los Angeles to accommodate her availability as well as the original vision of director Lisa Cholodenko (B.A., Interdisciplinary Studies, ’87).\nThough best known for her roles in movies such as\nAmerican Beauty\nand\nBugsy\n, Bening still adores her first love: theatre. Earlier this year she performed and directed\nRuth Draper’s Monologues\nat Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, garnering critical acclaim.\n“The intellectual size that you have to possibly reach for, combined with incredible emotional content — That’s what gets me about the theatre,” she said.\n—Lynn Brown\nNews Article",

He had initially been content to keep the panoramic views he witnessed to himself, Jassen has now paired his passion for flying with photography to capture some of the United States’ undiscovered vistas. Todorov’s photos always attempt to capture bold geometry and saturated color above vast landscapes such as Yellowstone National Park. His flights run from the quiet beauty of an airplane boneyard in the Mojave Desert, California, to the stunning Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, and Death Valley.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Friday, March 04, 2016\nHUFFINGTON POST -- Some people call America a melting pot, and perhaps it is. Migrants to America struggle with their traditions. Some embrace America immediately and, like the Poseidonians, erase their culture. Others try to marry the two traditions. A telling example of saving the phenomena of both cultures comes from the poetry of Thanasis Maskaleris. His book, “My Life on the Ragged Paths of Pan,” is testimony of a life in perpetual struggle. Maskaleris came to America in the 1950s from Arkadia, Peloponnesos, home of the gods, especially Pan, beautiful villages, countless olive trees and mountains. He studied literature and taught comparative literature at San Francisco State University, where he was also instrumental in the creation of the Center for Modern Greek Studies. But Maskaleris is fundamentally a poet speaking in the often-illuminating language of poetry. His book includes original poems and translations from some of the most insightful of modern Greek poets.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

But until this week, when the university introduced a new line of buses, the disability centers on campus offered a fair warning to wheelchair users to avoid the shuttles and instead take Muni. “In the past, more people have advised wheelchair users to use Muni because it’s easier to get on and off the trains or buses,” said Catherine Kudlick, director of the Paul K.

    "content": "Monday, March 23, 2020\nKQED NEWS (SAN FRANCISCO) -- Aaron Borunda, a senior at San Francisco State University, said he'd been looking forward to this spring semester for his whole college career. He'd gotten past his core classes and could now take more advanced ones.\nBut ever since SFSU postponed graduation and shifted classes online on March 9, that excitement has drained. As a broadcast and communications arts major, most of his classes are almost impossible to do anymore, he said, since they normally would involve setting up video equipment and filming people.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Dano hosts the weekday afternoon show from 3 to 7pm on Sonoma County’s radio station Froggy 92.9. He returned to Santa Rosa Junior College in fall 2003, taking general education classes until he found an interest in a radio class before the department canceled it. He then transferred to San Francisco State University as a Radio and Television major, with an interest in audio production. One night he was in his room listening to Loveline on the radio with Adam Carolla when a lightbulb went off in his head. “I think I want to do that [host a radio]. I do that all the time with my friends, joking around,” Dano said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

He has just written a smashing op-ed for The New York Times that forcefully outlines his government’s approach to the negotiations. It deserves a standing ovation. “Currently Greece has been receiving a bailout in stages, but only on the condition that it imposes brutal austerity measures on the Greek working class and poor, including laying off state workers, lowering the minimum wage, imposing regressive taxes and weakening labor union rights. ”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, October 27, 2020\nTHE DAILY WIRE -- Earlier this year, an academic study from political scientist Aaron Belkin of San Francisco State University and James Druckman of Northwestern University’s Institute for Policy Research openly encouraged Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, asserting the party would face little political fallout, if any. The study was funded by the progressive group Take Back the Court, which has openly championed court-packing as a solution to a conservative judiciary.\nIn the study, participants were asked to choose between two hypotheticals: a “status quo” scenario and a scenario in which a Democratic Party candidate proposes court-packing to “bring greater balance to the court” while the Republican Party candidate laments how it would be “a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the rights of all Americans by radical liberals trying to change the rules so a few cities in New York and California can impose their will on the rest of us.” According to the study, scenario two had almost no impact on people’s choices.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Monday, May 16, 2016\nSALON -- Jason McDaniel, SF State Political Science assistant professor, and Sean McElwee, Demos Action policy analyst, discuss results of their new research about supporters of GOP candidate Donald Trump.\n“Of course, any human phenomenon will be complex and nuanced, so a certain amount of humility is required. Nonetheless, in our newest analysis, we examine the feelings expressed by Trump supporters towards a variety of groups in America, and the results are pretty clear: Trump supporters really dislike many identity groups in America. For these voters, Trump’s blend of casual racism and muscular nativism is the core of his appeal.\n“Trump supporters are more likely than supporters of other Republican candidates to have negative feelings toward feminists, Muslims, Latinos, gays and lesbians and transgender people. These findings also hold when compared to supporters of Hillary Clinton. In contrast, Trump supporters have far warmer feelings toward whites than supporters of other candidates.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The report, from the San Francisco State University’s Palm Center think tank’s Planning Commission on Transgender Military Service, states, “Our conclusion is that allowing transgender personnel to serve openly is administratively feasible and will not be burdensome or complicated.

She wrote this piece for Faculty Focus.\n“Negative feelings about students may creep up from time to time, so we must start the relationship process by working on ourselves, and reflecting on our role as a teacher by examining how our personal and cultural experiences inform our teaching practices and biases of students (Patton, 2016). We must also appreciate the multiple intersecting identities students bring to the classroom and support them with a curriculum that affirms and embraces diversity (Mahiri, 2017),” Wong wrote. “... I also draw from faculty in SF State’s writing program who have researched undergraduate writers (Soliday and Trainor, 2016). Based on their research, students thrive when their writing courses maximize student engagement and agency, focus on students’ emerging identities, and provide welcoming pathways into academic communities.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Is this story within a story within a story meant to be identifiable to anyone? Are those really ghosts? Is Heathcliff a critique of mid-19th century British class structure, a rotten bastard or simply one who loves and revenges harder than any made for TV adaptation can handle?\nLike the cosmos,\nWuthering Heights\nis vast.

The plan includes new buildings and renovations, infrastructure improvements, and preventative and deferred maintenance.\nBasis of the Multi-Year Capital Plan\n(CSU)\nMulti-Year Capital Plan 2021/2022 through 2025/2026\n(CSU)\nPlease note that\nnot all of the approved projects are funded\ndue to the limited resources available. Projects included in the current version of these lists that are in italics have previously received approval from the Board of Trustees, and projects in red italics have received prior approval from both the Board of Trustees and Department of Finance. Because these projects have already been approved, they are included in the current Multi-Year Capital Plan in order to identify their need for funding and provide information on the current outstanding sytemwide priority needs and not for specific project approval.\nSpace and Facilities Database (SFDB)\nThe California State University\nSpace and Facilities Database\n(SFDB)​ is a CSU systemwide inventory of campuses’ physical resources that serves as the official CSU central record for current physical inventory. CPDC coordinates campus facility planning through the development and management of the SFDB. This database, updated annually, is a key component in determining the need for capital improvement projects as well as equitable space distribution across campus. The campus physical master plan and the various capital improvement projects are based, in part, on information obtained from the SFDB.\nEach campus maintains its own space and facilities inventory that provides planning and management data. The data provided by each campus during an annual reporting period to the SFDB, which is maintained at the Chancellor’s Office, provides information about facilities and rooms within the facilities.\nThe SFDB serves as the campuses’ official record of existing spaces. The SFDB is used in the\nanalysis of space needs\nanalysis of the capital outlay budget change proposals (COBCP)\nspace utilization and other space and facilities-related issues and reports\ncustodial funding basis\nprivate-use reporting\nAny proposed changes to space that will change the use, size, or capacity must be coordinated with CPDC. Authorization to change a space must be received prior to the start of any projects that will impact the activity the space was built to accommodate.\nSpace Standards\nThe CSU Space Standards are based on the state's guidelines to help the campus plan and budget for physical capacity space during the programming of a new facility. Space Standards can help define the room use and assignable square footage of lecture, teaching lab, and office spaces and can be applied to analyze the space needs and entitlement of the campus.\nReference\nSpace Standards Chart\nSUAM Section VI\nQuestions?\nRon Kirkpatrick\n,\nDirector of Capital Planning and Special Projects\nNicholas Holmes\n, Associate Planner / Project Manager",

    "content": "French Program\nThe French Program offers a wide selection of undergraduate and graduate courses in French language, literature and culture as well as providing the following degree options: Master of Arts in French, Bachelor of Arts in French (major) and a minor in French.\nThe French program offers a challenging and enriching experience for those who are interested not only in the French language but also in French and Francophone culture and society. French is one of the very few languages spoken all over the world, ranked the sixth most widely spoken language after Mandarin Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic.  Today, more than 220 million people speak French throughout the world: roughly 51% live in Africa and the Middle East, 40% live in Europe, 8% in the Americas, and 1% in Asia/Oceania.  As a result of population growth there will be more than 700 million French Speakers by 2050, 80% of whom will be living in Africa. The French Program is excited to offer an an avenue to engage with this expanding and diverse Francophone cultural and linguistic world.\nWe offer full-fledged Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts programs and focus on developing proficiency in the language in a sociocultural context by offering a variety of courses and by conducting courses in culture and literature in French. Great importance is placed on participatory classes, which are small and practice-oriented, to help students adapt themselves to a changing world. Excellent computer facilities and a multimedia center provide support for our educational program.\nSF State is located in San Francisco, a cosmopolitan city with a large and active French community, which makes it a great place to study French. Students are also given a number of opportunities to study in France. Through the California State University’s international programs, selected students may study at Aix-en-Provence and in Paris. Such opportunities give students practical experience in everyday French life and culture, helping to build and reinforce these skills.\nIf you are an undergraduate student and wonder which class to take, you can take a placement test and see an advisor.

Students can also participate in an exchange program with universities in Paris (MICEFA), also coordinated by the office of International Programs on campus. The number of credits earned abroad that may be counted towards the major is 15 (towards the minor is 10), and determined though consultation with the appropriate French Program advisor at San Francisco State University.\nMasters of Art (Advancement to Candidacy)\nThe M.A. Program in French at SF State requires the completion of 30 units of course work in French Literature, culture or language, and offers two different culminating experience options: Master's Comprehensive Written and Oral Examinations, or a Master's Thesis and Master's Comprehensive Oral Examination.\nOption I\n30 units of coursework and Comprehensive Written and Oral Examinations.\nOption II\n27 units of coursework and FR 898 Master’s Thesis (3 units), plus a Master’s Comprehensive Oral Examination.\nStudents must take a minimum of 15 units of graduate courses in French.\nFor the remaining courses, they have the choice of 6 units of graduate / paired courses in French, and 9 or 6 units (according to the option) of graduate /paired / undergraduate courses in French, or related subjects. For instance, students interested in the teaching profession can take two courses in related subjects from the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures: Curriculum and Instruction I and II, e.g. 6 units of graduate course work towards the completion of their degree.\nTransfer of units and cross-registration:\nYou may transfer up to 12 units taken as an Unclassified Graduate Student at SF State, subject to approval of the graduate adviser.\nIf you cannot find courses to meet your interests or time schedule in our program, you may take up to 3 units per semester through cross-registration at other universities, in particular U.C. Berkeley, subject to approval by the graduate advisor.\nYou may transfer up to 6 post-baccalaureate units you took at another university, subject to approval by the graduate advisor in French and the graduate division of SF State, as long as these units were not counted towards another diploma.\nLevel I and Level II English requirement\nAll graduate students at SF State must complete Level I and Level II writing English requirements. The level I requirement is met when applying to the French M.A. program, by giving to the French Program a statement of purpose in English (500 words) along side the same or a similar statement written in French.\nThe level II writing requirement needs to be met while in the graduate program. It can be met in the following ways:\nOption I:\nby submitting for evaluation to the French faculty either a 15-20 page essay written in English for a graduate class (program other that the French Program), or the English translation of a 15-20 page essay written in French for a graduate class from the French Program, unless the French instructor of that class accepts to receive an essay written in English.\nOption II:\nstudents writing a thesis must write a 15-page summary of their thesis in English, if they do not choose option I. This summary will be submitted for evaluation to the French faculty.\nIn order to fulfill this requirement successfully, discuss how to be best prepared for it with the graduate advisor early in the course of your graduate studies, especially if English is not your first language or if you have deficiencies in writing.\nFor more information on the M.A. Program in French requirements and option, consult the following documents:\nCheck list for French M.A. Students (found on the\nFrench Resources page\n)\nFrench M.A advising worksheet\nGuidelines Thesis – French (found on the\nFrench Resources page\n)\nReading List – French M.A.\nThe M.A. Program in French - Course Descriptions\nHere is a sample of French M.A. courses taught in the past 3 years:\nL’Amour et la Guerre au Moyen Age\nLes Femmes du Moyen Age à la Renaissance\nLe Corps à la Renaissance\nLe Conte de Fées du 17e siècle\nLe Spectacle du Moyen Age au 17e siècle\nLe Merveilleux du Moyen Age au 17e siècle\nLe Théâtre du 17e et 18e siècle\nLes Philosophes (18e siècle)\nLes Deux Sexes du Roman (18e siècle)\nLe Roman du 19e siècle\nParis: Capitale du 19e siècle\nMonstres du 19e siècle\nThéâtre et poésie romantique\nArt et Poésie 1860-1940\nLe Roman du 20e siècle\nHumour, Arts et Littérature (20e siècle)\nLa Francophonie (20e siècle)\nExhaustive on-line French M.A. course titles and descriptions are available in the University Bulletin.\nInternational Program\nStudents can do part of the M.A. degree in France. They can participate in an exchange program with universities in Paris (MICEFA), coordinated by the office of International Programs on campus. The number of credits earned abroad that may be counted towards the M.A. is determined though consultation with the Graduate French Program advisor at San Francisco State University.\nIn addition to the aforementioned requirements, students are advised to do the following:\nSeek Graduate Advising Every Semester\nStudents should plan their courses in consultation with the graduate advisor and fill out the “Advising Worksheet - M.A. student in French” every semester. Pay attention to the type of courses and number of units needed to graduate and cross-registration regulations if you want to take courses in universities such as U.C. Berkeley or other universities from the CSU system. Send an electronic copy to your advisor to keep him/her informed of the courses taken.\nIf you are conditionally admitted to the program, seek the advisor for “Advancement to Classified Graduate Standing” when you complete the courses specified as preconditions (Such course work may NOT be used to meet degree requirement).\nBegin studying early the document containing the “Reading List” of the French M.A. Program and the description of the culminating experience requirements (option I or option II). It is a good idea to begin preparing your reading list for the oral exam early on. It is also a good idea to start reflecting on your preferences concerning the culminating experience requirements. Check also the document: “Guidelines Thesis – French”.\nFulfill the Second Level English Proficiency Requirement\nAll graduate students must complete Level I and Level II writing English requirements. The level I requirement is met when applying to the graduate program, by giving to the French Program a statement of purpose in English (500 words) along side the same statement written in French.\nThe level II writing requirement needs to be met while in the graduate program. It can be met in the following ways:\nChoice I:\nby submitting for evaluation to the French faculty either a 15-20 page essay written in English for a graduate class (pr",

    "content": "Faculty-Student History Team to Create Graphic Novel Exploring First Black Marines\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nDecember 1, 2021\nPhoto Credit:\nIllustration by Liz Clarke\nSan Francisco State University Professor Trevor Getz will again bring an overlooked piece of history to light through a nonfiction comic book. Created with History undergraduate Robert Willis, the “The Montford Point Marine Project” will tell the stories of the first Black U.S. Marines, who served in World War II. The story is based on new oral histories of their experiences. It will be published by Oxford University Press in 2024.\nAimed at a high school and undergraduate audience, “The Montford Point Marine Project” will foreground the meaning and lessons the veterans themselves draw from their service and experiences. In a unique design, the book will include digital resources linking readers to interviews with Montford Point Marine veterans. These interviews are possible thanks to a contribution from The Boeing Co., and will be filmed in December by a team led by Cinema Professor Daniel Bernardi and San Francisco State alumnus Jesse Sutterley. Members of the National Montford Point Marine Association will also help direct the writing and design of the graphic novel.\nIn 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt outlawed racial discrimination in war industries, allowing Black men and women to serve in a segregated fashion. The Marines recruited Black men and sent them to Jacksonville, N.C., at Camp Montford Point, where about 20,000 African Americans trained between 1942 and 1949. The Montford Point Marines, as they came to be known, remain active in public service, support for their veterans and preservation of their legacy.\n“The Montford Point Marine Project” is the follow-up to Getz’s award-winning “Abina and the Important Men: A Graphic History” (Oxford University Press, 2011). That book depicts the life and trial of Abina Mansah, a woman living in 19th-century colonial West Africa who escapes slavery and takes her former master to court. Like “Abina,” the new book is designed to be a guide to historical research, in this case focusing on community-based oral history methods.\nThe team bringing this story to life includes Getzand Willis along with Montford Point Marine historian Gunnery Sgt. Joe Geeter III and artist Liz Clarke. “Through the life stories of the Montford Point Marines, we hope to train and inspire teachers and students to collect, interpret and value the memories, experiences and wisdoms of earlier generations,” Getz said. “The Montford Point Marine Project” has also received funding through the\nMarcus Undergraduate Research Assistantship Grant\n.\nTags\nDepartment of History\nVeteran Documentary Corps\nMarcus\nUndergraduate Research\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

In the ‘after,’ we follow the ups and downs of whether they can ever be together while the forces of the outside world bear down on their relationship.” Much like their roles on stage, the duo said their friendship also shares a special meaning. “The whole play is about evolving friendship, and I think anyone who has a best friend can relate to the situations these characters are put in,” Anderson said. “Both Lauren’s and my characters realize how special their friendship is, and that is why they fall in love.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

He has had, and continues to have a very successful career in photojournalism — even winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1987. He now shares his extensive career experience with his students and works to help them navigate the rapidly changing photojournalism industry. “On the first day of class I tell my students that one of the toughest tasks that a journalism teacher faces today is trying to teaching communication skills to students whose parents told them not to talk to strangers,” Komenich says. “In no small part my goal is to encourage students to look someone in the eye, to be comfortable in the void and to fight the urge to flee. To be curious and to let something ‘strike you.’ I try to teach that.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Tuesday, November 26, 2019\nINTERIOR DESIGN -- Rafael Delacruz’s psychedelic paintings of individuals situated in urban landscapes tap into the times’ increasingly rapid order with humor and nuance. The 30-year-old Brooklyn painter, who holds a bachelor’s degree in film theory from San Francisco State University, flexes his narrative-building muscles on canvas to chronicle everyday people’s interactions with urban architecture and objects — figures blend into street corners or objects become body parts.\n“In Handle with Care” (2019), an otherwise naked man dons a wooden barrel in public; “I Love My Key in My Head + Heart” (2019) shows a surreal moment in which a key enters through a keyhole which substitutes for a man’s nose.\n“Rafael manages to create deeply psychological portraits, brimming with magic,” said Bridget Finn, co-owner of Detroit-based Reyes | Finn. “The subjects of each work possess a superhuman quality within their modest settings, surrounded by psychedelic baguettes, adorned in large lapels and funky hats actively harnessing their own internal energy.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Bias Incident Education Team at SF State\nWelcome and Introduction\nWelcome to the webpage for the Bias Incident Education Team (BIET) at San Francisco State University.\nThis team works in collaboration with the\nOffice of Title IX and Discrimination, Harassment, Retaliation (DHR)\nto ensure that reports submitted are addressed by the appropriate area on campus. This page should provide basic information about the BIET and information about how to submit a report. At any time while reviewing this page, you are welcome to\nSUBMIT A REPORT\n(right click to open in new window). Please note, the Office of Title IX and DHR may review reports submitted to the Bias Incident Education Team to ensure the appropriate response.\nSF State and the Bias Incident Education Team are supporters of academic freedom, free speech, and free expression. Everyone at SF State has a right to a safe learning, living, and working environment. SF State views bias-related incidents as antithetical to our university community values of inclusion, belonging, and mattering. We have a collective responsibility to contribute toward an inclusive and welcoming campus environment for students, staff, faculty, administrators, and guests at SF State. We each play a critical role in maintaining a safe and respectful campus community. The Bias Incident Education Team is an important part of campus climate work at SF State.\nThe BIET's role on campus is educational. The team does not have a role or capacity to discipline or sanction anyone connected to reports submitted and no one is required to meet with the team. The goal of the team is to provide educational awareness and assist campus community members with strategies that will empower them to address bias incidents they encounter or observe.\nWhat is the Bias Incident Education Team (BIET)?\nThe Bias Incident Education Team reviews and addresses bias-related incidents and reports that deserve attention, but may not necessarily rise to the level of\nTitle IX / DHR\n(Discrimination, Harassment, Retaliation) or\nLabor / Employee Relations / HR\n(Human Resources). The BIET reviews incidents and determines an action plan rooted in individual and group education and learning.\nThe BIET accepts reports from SF State students, staff, faculty, administrators, and guests.\nThe BIET provides an outlet for people to share, document, and make known bias-related incidents they observe or experience. Ultimately, the BIET is one element of the collaborative processes at SF State to address and improve campus climate issues.\nWhat is a bias incident?\nSomething a person does, says, or expresses that is motivated by bias related to one or more identities, such as citizenship, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, sexual orientation, or more. While a bias incident may constitute protected expression, the incident may also promote mental stress, harm, or violence that can leave recipient(s) or observer(s) feeling unsafe, unwelcomed, and unincluded in the SF State community.\nWhy report bias incidents?\nReporting bias incidents helps us collect data about experiences that contribute negatively to the SF State campus climate. Reporting bias incidents helps foster a culture of accountability. Reporting bias incidents helps the BIET address incidents and provide educational action plans for the individuals, groups, or departments connected to bias-related incident. Reporting helps SF State understand where and how people experience bias on campus. Ultimately, reporting helps SF State become a more welcoming and inclusive campus.\nIf you witness or are made aware of bias-related incidents, we encourage you to\nSUBMIT REPORT\n(right click to open in new window). If you are uncomfortable submitting a bias incident report, ask a trusted colleague or friend to do it for you. You are also welcome to reach out to the\nchair/convener of the BIET, Frederick Smith\n, or any member of the BIET, listed in the next section.\nWho serves on the BIET?\nThe BIET consists of a group of SF State staff, faculty, and administrators from various parts of campus.\nThe current BIET members include:\nArlene Daus-Magbual\n, Director, Asian American & Pacific Islander Student Services\nCarleen Mandolfo\n, Associate Vice President, Faculty Affairs and Professional Development\nDemond Blanton\n, Manager, Workers' Compensation and Loss Control Programs\nFrederick Smith\n, Assistant Vice President, Equity & Community Inclusion (convener of the BIET)\nLarry Birello\n, Interim Manager, Student Rights & Responsibilities\nPatrick McFall\n, Coordinator, Academic Support and Leadership Development, Residential Life\nReggie Parson\n, Assistant Vice President, Campus Safety\nRick Nizzardini\n, Clinical Counselor, Counseling & Psychological Services and Residential Life\nTeddy Albiniak\n, Faculty, Communication Studies, and Chair, Academic Senate\nWhat if my situation might be beyond the scope of the BIET?\nThe BIET will review any report submitted. Because we work collaboratively with multiple campus partners, we may consult with or refer to departments that may be better equipped to address the issues raised in your report.\nTo that end, if you believe the incident you want to report goes beyond the scope of the BIET, we encourage you to connect with the following SF State resources:\nIf your situation involves an immediate/urgent emergency related to physical or medical safety, please contact the\nSF State University Police Department\n.\nIf your situation involves an immediate/urgent mental health emergency, please contact the\nSF State Counseling & Psychological Services\n.\nIf your report goes beyond the scope of the BIET, we will consult with some of the following campus partners:\nEmployment conduct issues (students, staff, faculty):\nSF State Labor & Employee Relations\n.\nStudent conduct:\nOffice of Student Conduct\nConduct related to CSU Executive Orders:\nSF State Office of Title IX and DHR (Discrimination, Harassment, or Retaliation)\nIf you would like a confidential consult about the incident of concern at SF State, we encourage you to contact the\nUniversity Ombudsperson\n.\nSubmit a report\nIf you want to submit a report to the Bias Incident Education Team, please click:\nSUBMIT REPORT\nAfter submitting, here are some next steps and what you can expect:\nSomeone will review your submission within 2 - 3 business days. If submitted during or before a weekend, there could be a longer review period.\nIf requested, a member of the Bias Incident Education Team will respond shortly after receiving and reviewing the report.\nThe BIET member will assess your report and situation, offer support, and then work with the BIET to determine an action plan.\nAt the conclusion of all available action steps, the BIET will sent a final letter/email to the person who initially submitted the bias incident reporting form. The final letter will include action steps (depending on confidentiality restrictions) and an opportunity to meet with a member of BIET to ask any remaining questions.\nAnyone who submits a report can ask questions about the status of the BIET work with the case at any time.\nWe acknowledge it takes courage to submit a report to the Bias Incident Education Team. Thank you.\nThank you\nThank you for taking time to learn more about the SF State Bias Incident Education Team. We appreciate your partnership in making SF State safe, inclusive, and welcoming for everyone who is a part of our campus community. If you have questions, please\nreach out to the BIET chair/convener, Frederick Smith\n.\nThe Equity & Community Inclusion Unit\nis open to all, and anyone interested in our activities and resources is welcome regardless of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.",

If you ask Bill Issel, San Francisco State University History professor emeritus, it always has been. Issel said “the three Ps” — pioneer spirit, patronage and Pacific orientation — were instrumental in forming the city’s artistic and cultural identity. “It was the place to be if you were young and adventurous,” said Issel, pointing to San Francisco’s instant population explosion during the Gold Rush and the fact that newcomers stayed because they weren’t tied down by institutional constraints. Larry Eilenberg, a professor of Theatre Arts for SF State, said the city was home to more than 1,100 productions — plays, operas (in five languages) and minstrel shows — from 1850 to 1859. “It was an extraordinary hub; all this money was rushing in,” Eilenberg said. On the literary front, SF State’s Poetry Center was founded in 1954 from a donation by W.H. Auden and City Lights Bookstore, Eilenberg said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

In 1973, a gay bar in New Orleans was set on fire in a case of suspected arson, and 31 people were killed. No one was ever charged, and there was very little national media coverage about it at the time.\n\"There’s a lot of attacks on gays bars, sometimes by individual or groups, often street violence against people who are coming and going to gay bars,\" said Marc Stein, professor of History at San Francisco State University.\nLGBT businesses, health centers, community centers and other public sites have also been targeted for attacks over the years. Stein himself worked at a LGBT newspaper that had been targeted with violence.\nAs Stein noted, there were demonstrations, riots and protests pressing for LGBT rights, especially throughout the 1960s. Influenced by other growing radical groups, including those for civil rights for blacks, women’s rights and the anti-war movement, groups advocating civil rights for gay people saw the importance of more public activism. Each year on July 4 from 1965 to 1969, protesters marched in support of LGBT rights in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, an event known as the “Annual Reminder.”\nPhoto by Mario Flores\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "'Tasting Difference': Professor Shahani Examines Recipes, Race in Early Modern Literature",
    "content": "Friday, October 30, 2020\nPhoto courtesy of Gitanjali G. Shahani\nWhen the witches in “Macbeth” call for the “fire burn and cauldron bubble,” they don’t just use a ghastly recipe to cast a spell. They invoke ethnic tropes — a historic literary reference to race — according to Professor Gitanjali G. Shahani’s new book,\n“Tasting Difference: Food, Race and Cultural Encounters in Early Modern Literature”\n(Cornell University Press).\nThe witches’ spell in William Shakespeare’s 17th-century “Macbeth,” still recited at Halloween school parties worldwide,  calls for discriminating ingredients: the liver of a “blaspheming Jew,” nose of a Turk and lips of a Tartar. It’s a recipe that labels people of certain groups as outsiders.\n“In addition to things like burnt snails and the chopped-up ears of a cat, one recipe calls for pounded skulls, preferably those found in the graves of Ireland,” added Shahani, chair of the English Language and Literature Department. “Some of these recipes are disturbing in the way they describe draining corpses of black and brown bodies for mummy, which was believed to have curative and cosmetic properties, and was consequently imported in large quantities via Egypt.”\nInternational exchange of food developed in the early modern period of 1500 – 1800. Taste buds expanded and new cuisines were created, but cultural differences were otherwise often not accepted. Early modern literature is stocked with references to food and medicine made from urine, dog tongues and unicorn horns. “It’s not the kind of stuff you get at Trader Joe’s!” Shahani said.\nIn researching “Tasting Difference,” Shahani studied plays, pageants, domestic manuals, cookbooks, ballads, travelogues and more. She discovered that early modern food writing evokes feelings of danger and allure. In “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” a character mentions a “spicèd Indian air by night.”\n“Long before the average English household encountered ‘an Indian,’ it encountered nutmeg and pepper in pies and potions,” said\nShahani\n, a Shakespeare scholar who studies connections between food and literature. “It is in the writing about these tastes, in the culinary realm that I saw an early conception of racial, cultural and religious difference being articulated.”\nA 17th-century broadside sheet depicts coffee as a dark figure from Shakespeare’s “Othello.” Contemporary food brands continue to perpetuate racial tropes with the title character, a dark-complexion Moor from Africa. Her SF State students introduced her to “Othello” chocolates, cookies and lattes made in the Bay Area.\n“When I was teaching ‘Othello,’ it was my students who kept pointing to the ways in which so many characters describe wanting to consume or devour all that is exotic about him,” Shahani said.\nExamining literary descriptions of food can help people can become more informed about today’s societal issues, including immigration, Shahani says.\n“Is it the immigrant we seek to keep out, while welcoming their culinary offerings?” Shahani asks. It’s something to think about when eating or reading (or both), as the calendar moves from Halloween toward Thanksgiving. “Food frequently becomes the means of rendering difference more palatable.”\n— Matt Itelson\nVideo\nNews Article",

A course in biological and physical sciences specifically related to CSD may not be applied for certification purposes to this category unless the course fulfills a university requirement in one of these areas.  Please see details about ASHA Standard IV-A at this link:\nhttps://www.asha.org/certification/course-content-areas-for-slp-standar…\nApplicants who do not meet one of these requirements will be denied admission.\nHow are applicants scored by the review committee?\nAt least two faculty members individually review each applicant's file and rate the applicant using the rubric at this\nlink\n.\nRatings of all faculty members are combined and the applicants are rank ordered.  The top 100 applicants are invited for a group interview.\nAlthough 95% of all applicants meet our minimal acceptable standards, the actual acceptance rate is lower, with GPAs generally at 3.5 or higher, due to limited seats available in our program.  We admit 40 graduate students each fall semester.\nSample SFSU Graduate Admission Application Scoring Rubric from Fall 2021.pdf\n488.47 KB\nWhat are the academic and clinical practica requirements for the M.S. degree in speech-language pathology?\nSan Francisco State University is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences is accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) in Speech-Language Pathology, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC), and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).\nThe Master of Science degree program for speech-language pathology includes 38 units of core academic courses and 20 units of clinical practica as recommended/required by the Council for Clinical Certification (CFCC) of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance, and the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, respectively.\nHow long will it take to complete the graduate program?\nThe length of the program is related to full-time or part-time enrollment. For example, full-time enrollment is equal to about 15 units each semester. With an undergraduate degree in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, the full-time classified graduate student should complete the requirements for the Master of Science degree in two years (5 semesters).\nHow many students are enrolled in the program and what is the average class size?\nThere are approximately 160 students enrolled in the SLHS department (approximately 80 undergraduate students and 80 graduate students). Our students are representative of the rich diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area. The size of undergraduate courses averages 30 students. The size of graduate courses averages 20 students. On-campus clinics are limited to 6 students per clinical supervisor.\nTell me about the on- and off-campus clinical experiences in speech-language pathology\nA minimum of 400 clock hours in a minimum of three types of clinical settings serving adults and children with a variety of communicative disorders is required by ASHA. Graduate students typically take a clinic every semester of their enrollment in the SLHS department.\nGraduate students are required to complete two clinics on campus, one with a child client and one with an adult client. Off-campus clinical practica occur during the student's seocnd year, with one semester at a puiblic school, and one semester in a hospital/ rehabilitation/ community or other setting.\nWhen I complete the graduate program, what qualifications will I possess?\nDEGREE.\nGraduates of the SLHS department possess a Master of Science degree in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences, with a specialty in speech-language pathology.\nASHA CERTIFICATION.\nIn addition, graduates are eligible for the Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) in speech-language pathology by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). Although not a legal requirement, ASHA certification is recognized by employers throughout the nation as a symbol of professional training and competence, particularly for speech-language pathologists. Please visit\nASHA's website\nfor more information.\nASHA requires that, after graduation, the individual undergo a 9-month full-time clinical fellowship (CF) experience, in which he or she is employed while being supervised by someone who holds ASHA certification. Upon completion of the CF experience, coupled with state licensure (see below), the individual can practice independently.\nCALIFORNIA STATE LICENSURE.\nThe practice of speech-language pathology in the state of California requires a license issued by the Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Board (SLPAB). Exempt settings are public schools and federal agencies. The academic and clinical requirements for state licensure essentially parallel those for ASHA certification. Following graduation, the individual undergoes a Required Professional Experience (RPE) for 9 month's full-time employment while supervised by someone who holds CA state licensure. After the RPE is completed, the individual can practice independently.\nSPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY SERVICES CREDENTIAL (SLPSC).\nThe SLPSC is issued by the CA Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC) for individuals intending to practice speech-language pathology in the public schools. Recent legislation allows speech-language pathologists who possess a CA state license to work in the schools as consultants without the SLPSC. Be advised, however, that many school districts are choosing to hire only individuals who hold the SLPSC. Therefore, it is recommended that graduate students complete the requirements for the SLPSC.\nOnce the graduate has completed the requirements for the Speech-Language Pathology Services Credential with or without Special Class Authorization, the credential(s) will be awarded following proof of receipt of the Master of Science degree, a passing score on the Praxis II Speech-Language Pathology Test, and completion of a 36-week, full-time, mentored clinical experience or equivalent supervised practicum.\nWhat are the special areas of expertise and research for the SLHS faculty and advisers?\nIn addition to academic teaching, most full-time SLHS faculty supervise on- and off-campus clinical practica. Faculty who teach a disorder seminar usually are responsible for supervising therapy for the clients with the disorder. SLHS faculty are engaged in scholarly and clinical research activities within faculty-developed research labs. These activities provide a well-rounded mix of academic and reality-based experiences that are shared with the SLHS students.\nThe SLHS department benefits from the academic and clinical expertise of a number of part-time lecturers and supervisors. For more information, visit the\nFaculty and Staff\npage.\nWhat are the costs for the program and what financial support is available?\nInformation regarding tuition (residency requirements, out-of-state tution, etc.) can be accessed at the\nOffice of Student Financial Aide\n.\nA variety of scholarships are opportunities are available within the SLHS department and beyond. For more information, visit the\nSLHS department scholarship information page\n.\nWhen are classes offered and will I be able to work and complete the program?\nAll of the undergraduate and graduate courses in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences are offered once per year. The classes are arranged in a yearly sequence so that fall semester courses are prerequisites for spring semester courses. Second year undergraduate/graduate courses require completion of the first year coursework. Therefore, it is not advised to apply to the SLHS department in the spring semester without prior coursework in SLHS.\nAll undergraduate and graduate coursework in the SLHS department is offered in 3 hour blocks, once a week, during the daytime (e.g., 9:30 - 12:15 p.m. or 12:30 - 3:15 p.m.) The average full-time courseload is four classes, so a student's schedule may require them to be on campus all day Monday (2 classes), Tuesday morning (1 class), and Thursday afternoon (1 class), for example. On-campus clinics are offered twice a week in 90-minute blocks, usually in the late afternoon (e.g., 4:00 - 5:30 p.m., or 5:30 - 7:00 p.m.).\nMany of the current students in the SLHS department balance part-time employment and their academic pursuit, but working more than 10 hours a week is not recommended. Taking less than a full-time academic load will lengthen the estimated time required to complete the master's degree. (See #5 & #6 above).\nHow many coursework units in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences will I be able to transfer into the program at SFSU?\nAll undergraduate coursework in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences taken at other CAA-accredited SLHS programs is transferable.\nA maximum of 6 semester units in graduate coursework in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences taken at other CAA-accredited SLHS programs is transferable into the master's program at SFSU.\nCan I take prerequisite courses in the SLHS department as a non-matriculated student?\nWe are currently able to accommodate students who are not in the SLHS department, although we have limited seating and priority is given to SLHS students. You may also want to pursue taking such coursework online. The SFSU SLHS department does not offer online coursework; however, there are other ASHA accredited universities that do. Visit\nEdFind\nfor a current listing of those programs and search for programs in speech-language pathology that have \"distance education availability\".\nHow can I learn more about the SLHS department and San Francisco State University?\nAfter exploring the remainder of this website, you may want to contact the SLHS office (415.338.1001 or\nslhsinfo@sfsu.edu\n) to make an appointment to meet with an adviser. Or you may\ncontact the appropriate SLHS faculty\ndirectly.",

    "content": "Friday, November 21, 2014\nPHILADELPHIA TRIBUNE -- The versatile and distinctive voice of Johnny Mathis has been enchanting audiences around the world since the age of 19. He was an athletic scholarship freshman at San Francisco State College in 1955, when Columbia staff A&R producer George Avakian “discovered” him singing in a Bay Area nightclub. Mathis was not yet 21 when he finally arrived in New York City for his first recording sessions with Avakian in 1956. Columbia A&R chief Mitch Miller took over Mathis’ hit-making production reins from 1957 to 1960. In spite of a very busy tour schedule and many charity events, Mathis recently found time to speak, and his was evident. “Life is good … I’m old!” proclaimed the 79-year-old crooner. Mathis has sold well more than 350 million records worldwide as confirmed by Guinness music chart, but it is the holiday season that resonates with him. Since 1958, Mathis has recorded five albums of Christmas music.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The AIDS Memorial Quilt has grown over the years and is now the biggest community arts project in the world.\nJones himself is HIV positive and has been since the late 1970s. He was a part of the early drug trials and has described the rapid effect the treatment had on his condition.\nWorking tirelessly to help the LGBTQ community, Jones is also heavily involved in the Sleep With the Right People campaign, which asks LGBTQ tourists to only choose hotels that respect their employees’ rights.\nAppearing on marches and in documentaries is part and parcel of Jones’ activism, and he led the National March for Equality in 2009.

They, along with Willie Brown and later Pelosi, engineered what became known by critics as “the Burton Machine.” Willie Brown met John Burton in 1951 when both were freshmen college students at San Francisco State University. “We were in the same ROTC unit, believe it or not, probably avoiding the draft,” Brown recalled with a chuckle recently. “We were alphabetically lined up the first day.

According to San Francisco State Political Science Professor Jason McDaniel, it may not be away from the progressive wing altogether, but simply to a different kind of progressive, measured rather than pugilistic when it comes to techie relations. Kim tried that tactic in her first years as supervisor, before — as Richard Edward DeLeon, the author of “Left Coast City,” puts it — she “regained her progressive mojo” and adopted a more hard-line stance. Haney faces the same challenge, synthesizing social justice and Soylent. “The progressive faction, like any good political party, is able to coordinate around the candidates that are a good fit for their districts, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all style,” McDaniel says.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Art Lecturer Sean McFarland: An Echo in the California Landscape",
    "content": "Thursday, October 19, 2017\nDuring his year teaching in Rochester, New York, Sean McFarland rarely took pictures. He spent more time working with his personal archive of images of the Western landscape. After returning to his beloved San Francisco in 2015, McFarland has again thrived in the Bay Area’s art community, teaching at SF State full time and garnering stellar reviews.\nArtforum, the world’s premier art magazine, reviewed and recommends McFarland’s solo exhibition at the Casemore/Kirkeby gallery in San Francisco.\n“Sean McFarland treads lightly through the history of Western landscape photography,” critic Kim Beil writes. “In this exhibition,\nEcho\n, he utilizes the familiar iconography of mountains and waterfalls, but his treatment undermines the presumptions of truth, power and possession that have long been associated with the genre.”\nEcho\nat Casemore/Kirkeby is on display through October 28. Works by McFarland are also featured in the SF State Fine Arts Gallery exhibition\nRecollected: Photography from the Archive\n, open through November 16. As a winner of the 2017 SECA Art Award, McFarland was also featured in a recent exhibition at the SFMOMA.\nA landscape that ‘transcends skepticism’\nMcFarland, a lecturer in the School of Art, constructs his artwork using found photographs, double exposures, prismatic effects and various light-sensitive materials. He has also incorporated found materials such as bottle caps to create moons and glass to create mountains. Using the suggested immediacy of Polaroids and photography’s claim to veracity, McFarland plays with our notion that when we see something we feel like we are there.\nHe hopes that his work makes people reflect upon nature and the environment.\n“Normally Polaroid pictures hold ordinary events like birthday parties or family trips,” McFarland says. “When used to represent the sublime in the landscape, our understanding of the medium as this handheld, rapid, intimate and immediate process does something special — we see a rare or impossible view as both accurate and accessible.\n“When I create collages and sculpture assemblages then take Polaroids of them, we read those images as truthful accounts of, say, a stunning mountain, even if the source material is a hunk of Plexiglas,” he adds. “Why do we do that? We have a capacity to be amazed by the landscape that transcends skepticism.”\nHe cherishes the natural beauty of Mono Lake and the Glass Mountains in the Eastern Sierras as much as the human-made “diorama” of Golden Gate Park. All are some of his favorite places to shoot photographs.\n“The way I work allows me to access a range of materials and depictions of the land as a part of the Earth because they describe ways we contend with understanding the landscape,” McFarland says. “This approach allows me to move between historical and contemporary constructions of the natural world, a very complex archive in the western United States.”\nInspired by SF State’s students\nMcFarland entered Humboldt State University as a computer information sciences major, not discovering photography until his junior year. He completed his bachelor’s degree as a double major, then moved to San Francisco in 2002 to pursue his Master of Fine Arts from California College of the Arts.\nAt SF State, McFarland teaches undergraduate photography courses and interdisciplinary Master of Fine Arts seminars and advises students. He views SF State as the ideal campus for art students and instructors alike.\n“It is so desirable to be able to teach at an arts school that students can afford to attend,” he says. “Students come from all different disciplines. The range of interests and differences of my students is inspiring.”\nHe enjoys sharing with his students the struggles and triumphs of his career.\n“My personal and professional experiences have been very humbling,” McFarland says. “Make mistakes. Be open to your path and your career. As a teacher and an artist, it’s important to remain active and knowledgeable about how art can challenge and be relevant, and to live that exciting process with students.”\n— Matt Itelson\nVideo\nSean McFarland: Impossible Wilderness\nfrom\nYBCA\non\nVimeo\n.\nLinks\nSean McFarland:\nEcho\n, Casemore/Kirkeby\nRecollected: Photography from the Archive\nReview in Artforum\nSFMOMA SECA Art Award, Sean McFarland\nSean McFarland\nSchool of Art\nPhoto: Sean McFarland in his studio at the Minnesota Street Project in San Francisco.

This will mark the SFSU debut of the ZOFO Duet of pianists Keisuke Nakagoshi and Eva-Maria Zimmermann. They have prepared a something-old-something-new program that will include music they were performing when the duo was first formed as well as a world premiere. The program will begin with George Gershwin’s four-hand arrangement of his “Cuban” overture, which provided the opening track from ZOFO’s second recording, “Mosh Pit.” This will be followed by Claude Debussy’s six Épigraphes Antiques, included on ZOFO’s debut CD, “Mind Meld: Works for One Piano, Four Hands.” This music was originally composed for the recitation of six poems by Pierre Louÿs with accompaniment provided by two flutes, two harps and celesta. The first half of the program will then conclude with “Etude from the Old Country,” composed by Terry Riley.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

He had us write lists of all these things, like really long, exciting words, short words, character names, subjects or themes we were really interested in, and he’d give us a minute for each one, and we’d write as much as we could down. He was like, ‘Now you have all these things to pull from when you’re looking for new stories, and you can go back to these.’ It was around this time that I started realizing that my process involved starting with theme more than character. So when I was looking over the list of things I had generated in his class, I realized that consent and sexual assault and rape were something that I was really interested in, but I didn’t want to approach it in the sense that I see it so often done.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The Times article last week on “Wind” — which stars another legend, John Huston, playing a film director struggling to get his final film made — said the movie’s release may be imminent. Ego clashes and rights issues among Welles’ heirs and collaborators kept it in limbo for decades. McBride, of course, jumped at the chance to act for Welles in “Wind.” In a note last week, McBride explained, “I play the film critic and historian Mister Pister, who is following around John Huston’s director character, Jake Hannaford, writing a book about him and asking him intrusive film-buff questions.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "The Charlatans, Band Described As Too Wild for the 1960s, Formed at SF State",
    "content": "Thursday, September 28, 2017\nFLASHBAK -- When Lewis transferred to San Francisco State College in 1962, Hunter followed her there, too. And that’s how he met his future co-founder of the Charlatans, Richard Olsen, who’d left Chicago a year or so earlier to study jazz and maybe, just maybe, make it as a musician in the vibrant jazz scene in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood.\n“I actually met Lucy before I met George,” Olsen says. “She was a dancer, and I was a music major, studying clarinet—we were both in the creative arts department at San Francisco State.” Before long, Hunter and Olsen were collaborating with Lewis on the dance performances she was choreographing with her roommate, Joan Alexander. Lewis recruited Olsen to be one of her dancers. Hunter, whose interest in hi-fi audio components was as keen as his affinity for architecture, provided the sounds.\n“George was into in tape music,” Lewis says, referring to a genre of prerecorded audio championed by composer John Cage. “We gave him this little broom closet to work in, and he transformed it into a music studio.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

He began vocal lessons, including classical and operatic styles, at age 13. Yet, in high school, he also was talented enough at track and field to get an athletic scholarship to San Francisco State University and, later, an invitation to try out for the U.S. team heading to the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. Around that same time, however, while performing at a San Francisco nightclub, Mathis caught the ear of George Avakian, head of jazz A&R at Columbia Records, who was vacationing in the city. “Have found phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way,” Avakian telegrammed his label. “Send blank contracts.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Now he is one of four artists featured in the commission’s\nArt on Market Poster Series\ndevoted to the original peoples of the San Francisco Bay Area.\nPotosí’s six posters, titled “The Future of the Ramaytush Ohlone,” are on display at 15 Muni bus shelters on Market Street between Seventh and Steuart streets through Friday, Feb. 28. Each poster centers a figure against a backdrop that depicts historical and cultural locations in San Francisco, enhanced with native plants and animals. The designs also include silhouettes inspired by historical paintings of the Ramaytush Ohlone, accompanied by text reflecting the Indigenous tribe’s cultural values and aspirations. The Ramaytush Ohlone tribe comprises the Native peoples of the San Francisco Peninsula.\n“Marcelo Potosí’s artwork beautifully and masterfully intertwines the rich cultural history of the Ramaytush Ohlone with visionary ideals for the future,” said Ralph Remington, director of cultural affairs for the San Francisco Arts Commission. “Through his striking poster designs, Potosí honors the deep-rooted legacy of the Ohlone peoples, while urging us to envision and reimagine a future grounded in respect for the land, its original stewards and the environment.”\nPotosí says he finds the Ramaytush Ohlone have much in common with his own Indigenous roots. He is a Kichwa-Otavalo person from Ecuador.\n“They are dedicated to giving back to the land and protecting it from pollution. This is also something we honor back in Ecuador,” said\nPotosí\n(B.A., ’24), who works as a freelance graphic designer. “By creating this poster series, I was trying to show the goals that the Ramaytush Ohlone have, and also just to let people know who the original peoples of this land were.”\nRead the full article at SF State News.\nRelated News\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025\nAn Amazonian adventure shifts SFSU student perspectives\nAugust 27, 2025\nIn new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nJuly 7, 2025\nSFSU student establishes nonprofit organization in memory of her son\nFebruary 24, 2025",

    "content": "Tuesday, June 05, 2018\nNATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO, CODE SWITCH --  Dollinger lays all this out in his new book,\nBlack Power, Jewish Politics: Reinventing the Alliance in the 1960s\n.\nDollinger, a professor at San Francisco State University, argues that much of our accepted knowledge about the interaction between black and Jewish communities is based more on myth than fact. He says uncovering the real story can teach all Americans a lot about privilege, historical memory and the way we construct our own stories.\n“I tell this story in the hopes that, even in the contemporary period, folks can take a deep breath and pause, whatever their initial reaction will be, to, you know, Black Lives Matter, the Women’s March, Farrakhan, Nation of Islam, all the topical issues now, and they’ll be better informed to understand the dynamics if they understand and see what actually happened over the last 50 or 60 years,” Dollinger says. “Clearly in Trump’s America, we have a variety of different constructed narratives, and everyone’s got a bunch of facts to prove that they’re right. And everyone is internally consistent, and nothing that anyone else says on the outside matters, you know, because they’ve got it right.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "In new book, SFSU professor revisits African American comedy of the 1980s and 1990s\nAuthor:\nMatt Itelson\nJuly 7, 2025\nPhoto Credit:\nCourtesy of Artel Great\n‘The Black Pack,’ by Artel Great of the School of Cinema, explores legacy of five influential comedians\nThe most popular African American-helmed comedies of the 1980s and 1990s made millions of people laugh, but San Francisco State University Associate Professor Artel Great has discovered a greater purpose in them. His new book, “The Black Pack: Comedy, Race and Resistance,” offers groundbreaking scholarly analysis on five influential artists of the era: Eddie Murphy, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Arsenio Hall, Robert Townsend and Paul Mooney.\nThese five men joined forces as a comedic collective known as “The Black Pack” and became household names as actors, writers, producers, directors and collaborators. In\n“The Black Pack” (Rutgers University Press)\n, Great cites 24 productions between 1987 and 1994 that defined a generation, both splitting sides and testing boundaries. In a review of “The Black Pack,” the Library Journal praises the book as “an entertaining and essential read.”\n“I call it ‘laugh-tivism.’ The book is a tribute to generations of Black American comedians and how they used their voices to challenge corrupt authority, to confront the racial condition in America and to say very serious things,” Great said. “The book speaks to this notion of revolutionary laughter, but it also speaks to the need for a creative space for laughter as catharsis and the need to create space for Black joy — and to do so through brotherhood and solidarity.”\nGreat\nis a scholar, filmmaker, actor and former standup comedian who holds SFSU’s George and Judy Marcus Endowed Chair in African American Cinema Studies. He appeared in films such as “Light It Up” and “Save the Last Dance” and landed an Independent Spirit Award nomination for “Dahmer” before earning his doctorate at New York University and later directing two feature films.\nFrom age 9, Great spent countless nights at his grandmother’s house in Chicago watching classics like Hall’s talk show, Townsend’s “Hollywood Shuffle” and Wayans’ “In Living Color.” It wasn’t until years later that he noticed how the rebellious, pro-Black themes spoke to sociopolitical issues that persist between generations.\nGreat traces the lineage of Black American comedy from slavery and vaudeville. In the late 19th century, a biracial man named Charley Case established the contemporary style of standup comedy. He would take command at center stage and speak directly to the audience, sometimes with minstrelsy makeup on his face, Great writes in “The Black Pack.”\nGreat plans to use “The Black Pack” in his SFSU School of Cinema courses, accompanied by viewings. He’s excited to observe how students react. Eddie Murphy films like “Boomerang” and “Coming to America” still make him laugh and give him feelings of nostalgia but may be new to them. More importantly, Great hopes students will be inspired to bring brightness to the world, with humor or without: “My ultimate goal is to always make our students more active and practical citizens.”\nLearn more about the SFSU School of Cinema\n.\nCourtesy of Rutgers University Press\nTags\nCollege of Liberal & Creative Arts\nCinema\nFaculty\nResearch\nRelated News\nDiscover 2025: See what makes life brighter at SFSU on Oct. 18\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU offers full scholarships for first-of-its-kind PK-12 certificate in climate justice education\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU is first CSU campus to join IBM Quantum Network\nSeptember 25, 2025\nSFSU alumna wins Creative Arts Emmy Award for hit documentary\nSeptember 24, 2025",

    "content": "Tuesday, February 07, 2017\nHOLLYWOOD SOAPBOX -- Purdy joined the Autry in 2011 and has created multimedia elements for 13 exhibitions. The interactive media productions she created for “Floral Journey: Native North American Beadwork” earned her a 2014 Silver Media MUSE award for video, film and computer animation. She has worked in multimedia production and cinema for a number of years and earned academic degrees from Indiana University and San Francisco State University. “There are a couple of things we want to accomplish with our project ‘Tending the Wild,’” Purdy Says. “First, we want people living in and visiting California today, to learn about how traditional ecological knowledge from indigenous communities from across California had sustained the environment for millennia and is still relevant today. It was very important for this story to be a contemporary story in collaboration with native communities about issues that impact all Californians and how TEK in partnerships could help inform how we tend our environment and even our planet.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

To learn more about these exciting programs, expand the accordions below or navigate to the respective page using the links.\nAcademic Master Plan\nVisit the Academic Master Plan Website\nCEETL\nVisit the CEETL Website\nFoundations of Excellence\nDuring 2016-2017, San Francisco State University conducted the Foundations of Excellence (FoE) first-year self-study. Faculty and staff from  Academic Affairs and Student Affairs & Enrollment Management provided input throughout the duration of the academic year to determine the barriers to success for our first-year students.\nTheir key recommendations fell into various categories: Academic and Social Engagement, Advising and Mentoring, Sense of Belonging, Organizational Structures and Bureaucracy, Communications and Professional Development for Faculty and Staff.  Among the high priority recommendations, the FoE steering committee recommended the institutionalizing of the first year experience collaboratively between Academic Affairs and SAEM.  In addition, this institutionalization of the first year experience is also part of efforts in terms of the campus Student Success and Graduation Initiative 2025.\nAmongst the high priority recommendations, the steering committee identified the following twelve as the highest priority recommendations:\nA first year faculty director from Academic Affairs and a first year director from Student Affairs should be appointed/hired.\nThe Academic Senate should create a first year experience steering committee consisting of campus members from Student Affairs, Academic Affairs and Associated Students. This committee should be chaired by the First Year Director from Student Affairs and the Faculty Director from Academic Affairs.\nThe Academic Senate should pass a resolution supporting a campus philosophy for the first year which aligns with our mission.\nA first year peer-mentoring program should be developed and supported financially.\nAn assessment plan should accompany any new FYE project.\nAll first year students should take a first year seminar. The FY Steering committee should investigate various models for such a seminar and make recommendations to the Academic Senate on the requirements for such a course.\nNew student orientation should be accessible for all incoming freshmen, in either an in person or virtual format.\nA communications plan for first year students and their families should be created.\nThe University should recognize and reward excellence in FY teaching. First year courses should  be desirable teaching assignments that are sought after by excellent teachers.\nProfessional Development should be made available for all faculty and staff who regularly  interact with first year students.\nThe Center for Equity and Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CEETL) should provide specific programming around engagement of first year students in the classroom.\nThe University must find ways to engage students outside the classroom. The academic and Nonacademic aspects of student life must be integrated.\nFor more information on First Year Experience at San Francisco State,\nvisit the FYE website\n.\nGrad Initiative 2025\nSF State's current graduation initiative includes:\nIncreasing our six-year graduation rate for first-time freshmen from 51% to 69%\nIncreasing our four-year graduation rate for first-time freshmen from 18% to 33%\nIncreasing our four-year graduation rate for transfer students from 76% to 86%\nIncreasing our two-year graduation rate for transfer students 37% to 49%\nEliminating the achievement gap\nTo meet the workforce demands of California’s economy, the CSU 2025 Initiative aims to graduate an additional 100,000 baccalaureate students, a total of more than one million, over the next ten years. SF State will contribute to this goal by increasing transfer and freshman graduation rates by an average of 11.25% and eliminating the opportunity gap.\nToward these ends, our campus plan is structured around six strategies:\nImproved course availability and curriculum;\nCoordinated, intrusive and strategic advising;\nBroad accessibility and visibility of student success data;\nHigh-quality student experience in the first year of college for incoming freshmen;\nEffective, targeted support services to achieve educational equity (directed specifically at our first-generation, low-income and underrepresented students, with special attention to men of color); and\nFaculty hiring and development\nGraduation Initiative 2025 is the CSU’s commitment to remove the obstacles to student success, enabling our students to experience transformation for themselves and a lasting impact on California.\nVisit the Graduation Initiative website to learn more.\nMetro Academies\nMetro is a campus-wide program that is based out of the College of Ethnic Studies. We offer learning communities (\"Academies\") in each of the colleges at SF State—Science & Engineering, Liberal & Creative Arts, Health & Social Sciences, Business, Education, and Ethnic Studies.\nLearn more about Metro\nRemaking Advising\nIn the Foundations of Excellence summary for advising and mentoring it notes many of our students declare a major prematurely, without adequate guidance about appropriate majors that would align with their goals and skills, contributing further to low engagement, underperformance, and attrition. Improving our lower-division curriculum, advising for undeclared students and career counseling will address this need. The goal of a peer mentoring program is to support First Year Students in their transition to SF State, encourage successful academic and personal development, promote student involvement and enrich the connections of SF State students to each other, the college and the SF State campus.\nAcademic Affairs, together, with support from SSGI funding, continues to invest numerous efforts into the Undergraduate Advising Center to help undergraduate students enjoy a successful college experience. There is a wide array of support available to our students so they have a clear academic path to  graduation.\nFor more information please visit the\nadvising website\n.\nSan Francisco State Scholars Program\nThe San Francisco State Scholars program provides undergraduate students with an accelerated pathway to a graduate degree.  Students in this program pursue a bachelor’s and master’s degree simultaneously. This program allows students to earn graduate credit while in their junior and/or senior year, reducing the number of semesters required for completion of a master’s degree. The San Francisco State University Scholars program offers students additional career prospects, intellectual growth and the opportunity to deepen skills and research competencies. In addition, Scholars program students will receive a unique form of mentorship that is not often expected at a large urban university.\nFor more information please visit the\nScholars program webpage\n.\nSF State Experimental College\nThe San Francisco State Experimental College (Exco) provides undergraduate students with an opportunity to design and teach a course based upon their own interests.  Exco student-teachers join a community of students who, together, deepen their understanding of the learning process through teaching other undergraduates who share their passions for the course topic.\nThrough a guided process of monitored syllabi development, student recruitment, peer mentorship, and weekly meetings, Exco student-teachers authentically develop skills in leadership, organizing, communication, research, and discussion-facilitation as well as discovering the joys of the creative process of lesson plan development.\nThe Teagle Foundation Report Release: In Search of Curricular Coherence\nThe mission of The Teagle Foundation is to advance the liberal arts, which we see as fundamental to meaningful work, engaged citizenship, and a fulfilling life. To translate our mission into practice, our grantmaking supports faculty who are committed to improving undergraduate education in the arts and sciences.\nWe have found that when courses proliferate without good reason, or students face a bewildering array of options to meet requirements, the curriculum can hinder rather than help them achieve a broad and deep education. The reform of curricula that may have become bloated or incoherent is therefore essential if students are to be well served.\nCurricular reform is never easy. Any serious effort involves many stakeholders and moving parts. Among other obstacles, institutions face financial constraints as they seek to improve learning, graduation rates, and the student experience. The typical additive approach to curricular design is not only unsustainable but may ill serve the goals of liberal arts education. Yet there are surprisingly few resources to help institutions navigate curricular reform, and faculty are rarely well prepared for their roles as stewards of the curriculum. As one Teagle grantee put it, \"I didn't get my Ph.D. in general education.\"\nWe hope that our latest evaluation report, \"\nIn Search of Curricular Coherence\n,\" which distills lessons learned from our \"\nFaculty Planning and Curricular Coherence\n\" initiative,  helps to close this gap in the literature. We partnered with Madeleine Green, who brought her deep experience from her 35-year career at the American Council of Education, to gather these lessons across\nour funded projects\nin this initiative. The projects focused on the role that curriculum plays as a driver of both quality and cost in higher education and how faculty could work together to create more coherent and efficient curriculum with goals, pathways, and outcomes that are clear to students. Participating faculty gained a wider perspective on their course offerings and how they strengthen--or detract from--the overall curriculum. The strategies they developed to promote curricular coherence took various forms, including efforts to curb course proliferation, develop themed and linked courses, and strengthen integrative advising in order to help students see the connections among their curricular and co-curricular experiences.\nDownload the report\nhere\n.\nLearn more about the Teagle Curriculum Redesign Initiative here.\nHere are two insights from the evaluation report:\nFaculty typically approach the charge of developing more coherent curriculum with one of two assumptions: that students must take the lead in integrating their curricular and co-curricular experiences, or that it is the responsibility of faculty to shape the curriculum into a coherent whole on behalf of students. These attitudes are not mutually exclusive, but because they are usually tacit rather than explicit in the institutional culture, they can make it difficult to achieve a shared understanding among faculty, and between faculty and students, of what a sensible undergraduate education should be.\nCurricular reform is a learning process for everyone involved. Institutions need to consider how their efforts to improve the experience of their students are tied to opportunities for faculty to develop their knowledge and understanding of how and what students should learn. Focusing on such questions can foster a climate of inquiry and learning, especially when institutions provide opportunities for a scholarly approach to the issues, involving colleagues within the department, the institution and across partner institutions.\nWe hope this report helps campuses overcome common barriers as they embark on their own curricular reform efforts. We extend our deepest appreciation to our grantees, who brought great creativity and dedication to their work, and without whom this report on lessons for the field would not be possible.\nLearn More:\nAcademic Master Plan\nCenter for Equity and Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CEETL)\nFoundations of Excellence\nGraduation Initiative 2025\nMetro Academies\nUndergraduate Advising Center (UAC)\nSan Francisco State Scholars Program\nSF State Experimental College\nThe Teagle Foundation Report Release: In Search of Curricular Coherence",

He works in queer studies, U.S. Literature and U.S. legal history; his writing has appeared in the Los Angeles Review of Books, ASAP/J, Nineteenth Century Literature and other venues. He wrote this opinion piece for The Rambling, a blog featuring essays by literature scholars. “As the summer wound down, I left my visiting position for a tenure-track job at San Francisco State University, a quite different campus in a famously activist city,” Clark wrote. “SFSU itself embodies the conflict between academic disciplinarity and the often-ignored needs of marginalized students; a historic, five-month student strike over the institution’s Eurocentric curriculum in 1968 gave birth to the nation’s first dedicated School of Ethnic Studies. Social justice is now at the core of the University’s pedagogical objectives. “Yet when I was tasked with teaching a class on the American Renaissance — the period of U.S. literature that put American writers like Melville, Emerson and Hawthorne at the center of American literary studies — I confronted the curricular requirements to cover a canonical history that felt at odds with the moment. How could I bring the energy of the summer to reflect on one of the most iconic—and white—periods of U.S. literature?”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

He is a fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center. The day after the presidential election, Postel participated in a panel discussion. “We’ve always had a brutal, racist, exclusionist, xenophobic, nationalist strain in American democracy. We’ve had it since the founding,” Postel said, “and sometimes it’s stronger than others. “In the 1920s we had a very strong presence of the Ku Klux Klan in national politics and state politics.

In “The Lucky Day,” Rose drives overnight to visit her mom in another state to wish her a happy birthday. Dealing with a serious illness and living with her son, Sam, her mother asks that Rose to take her to the races.\nThis immediacy runs through many of the stories; Chai captures the love, frustration, anger, disappointment and more that seeps through these family relationships: There’s the woman who is trying her best to live with her in-laws until she can no longer bear it; there’s the young daughter reeling from the discovery of her mother’s affair; and there's the young boy who appears docile and humble in front of his grandpa but leads a very different life on the city streets. In many ways, these characters seem to lead double lives — but maybe that’s just what being part of a family is all about, according to Chai.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "title": "Journalism Alumna Lands New York Times Fellowship",
    "content": "Friday, May 07, 2021\nPhoto by Daniel Kim\nIn fifth grade, Sarahbeth Maney (B.A., ’19) started carrying a camera with her everywhere. To this day it hasn’t left her side. In junior high school, after reading National Geographic, she decided she wanted to be a photojournalist. So when it came time to apply to college, she chose San Francisco State University, which was close to home in Martinez and had a photojournalism program. Now, two years after graduating, she’ll embark on a career-defining journey, camera still in hand.\nIn June, Maney begins a yearlong fellowship with The New York Times, along with 32 other promising young journalists and media professionals. The program replaces The New York Times’ summer internship program. Fellows work in areas ranging from graphics, science and art to photography. Maney will be based in Washington, D.C., and will do the work of any beat photographer covering stories on and off Capitol Hill. She’ll also get to travel with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\nThe fellowship was a long time in the making, she says. During and after college she held internships at the San Francisco Examiner, the San Francisco Chronicle and the Flint Journal in Michigan. As a freelancer, her work has appeared in Vanity Fair, The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal, among other well-known publications. This was her third time applying for the fellowship at The New York Times, and she says she was in shock when learned she got the position.\n“She is a talented photographer and a compassionate person, and you can see those qualities in her pictures.” — Lecturer Scot Tucker\n“I felt really proud of myself, especially because representation is really important,” she said. “To see the first-ever mixed-race woman in the White House as vice president, that was inspiring for me. When I realized I’m going to be able to document this time in history, it was an unbelievable feeling of excitement.”\nIt’s not just that she’ll be part of something historic, it’s personal for Maney. Like Harris, Maney is also multiracial. “Being a mixed-race woman and not growing up seeing a lot of people who looked like me, I think it’s really important to provide that sense of representation and let people know that their stories are relatable and that they matter,” she added. And those are the stories she hopes to continue telling.\nManey is someone who understands the importance of documenting Black and Brown communities, says SF State\nJournalism\nLecturer Scot Tucker, who taught her Introduction to Photojournalism class. “She is a talented photographer and a compassionate person, and you can see those qualities in her pictures,” he said.\nWhen she heads to Washington, she hopes to tell the human side of policy and how laws affect people’s daily lives, she says. One of the lessons she learned at SF State that she’ll take with her to Washington is the importance of reporting topics that are personal. Faculty encouraged that, she adds. “They wanted us to stay true to ourselves because we all have different perspectives to bring,” she said.\nThat’s one of many kernels of professional wisdom she gleaned from SF State. The others: anticipate the movement before it happens, be a good person and be sensitive. Having empathy is especially important these days, she notes. “With the coronavirus pandemic and the Black Lives Matter movement, it takes an extra level of sensitivity,” she said. “I feel like they prepared me to cover these tough situations.”\nBut it may be that she was just born for this. People trust her, says Tucker. “She recognizes the role of a journalist in the community. ... She takes amazing pictures, but the pictures aren’t for her,” he said. “She’s there to tell the story of the community. She recognizes she’s there to tell someone else’s story.”\n— Jamie Oppenheim\nNews Article",

    "content": "A Message from the Director\nWelcome to SF State’s School of Engineering website! I hope you and your family are well.\nThe School of Engineering has been serving the San Francisco Bay Area industry since 1959. Today, it remains the only accredited four-year engineering school in San Francisco and is currently\nranked #49 (82\nnd\npercentile) on the US News and World Report’s Best Undergraduate Engineering Program (No Doctorate) Ranking\n. We pride ourselves in offering four\nABET-accredited\nundergraduate engineering programs:\ncivil engineering\n,\ncomputer engineering\n,\nelectrical engineering\n, and\nmechanical engineering\n. As well as three\nmaster’s programs\nin civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. In addition, we have established four accelerated BS/MS programs, or\nSF State Scholars Programs\n, where students can complete their BS and MS degrees in 5~5.5 years. Together, these programs serve a highly diverse student body of 1,150 undergraduates and 100 graduate students, of which 43% are underrepresented minorities and 16.3% are female students. The majority of our graduates enter the workforce right after graduation and they are the driving forces in a myriad of industries in the San Francisco Bay Area and throughout California. Our alumni are not just technologists, but everyday heroes – from\ncompany CEO\nto\nenvironmental ecopreneur\nto\nTesla engineer-turned-housing activist\n– who are tackling challenges in different domains and changing the world through their unique ingenuities.\nThe School currently has\n25 tenured/tenure-track faculty\nand\nover 30 lecturer faculty\nin all four disciplines—and we expect to add\ntwo more tenure-track faculty\nin 2024! Our ethnically diverse and award-winning faculty features some of the best and brightest engineering educators and extraordinary role models dedicated to inspiring young minds and transforming engineering education. Among these faculty members are recipients of two National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Awards, multiple NSF and National Institute of Health (NIH) grants, Department of Energy grants, Air Force Research Laboratory grants, California State University (CSU) Faculty Innovation and Leadership Award, Sony Grand Prize, Synopsis Charles Babbage Grant, Google Faculty-in-Residence award, and American Chemical Society PRF grant. A good number of our lecturer faculty are technology entrepreneurs, senior technical and management staff at high-tech companies, and senior members of local government agencies. Indeed, just in 2023 alone, our faculty (1) secured a $3.75M award from the Department of Energy to establish a\nWestern IAC Center of Excellence\n, (2) received a $500K National Science Foundation CAREER award to study green infrastructure, (3) are recognized by companies including Synopsis, Sony, Keysight Technologies, and Instron with research and instrument grants amounting to $400K, and (4) won the SF State’s 2023 Excellence in Teaching (Lecturer) Award. Our faculty size may be small, but we pack a punch.\nAs we speak, an exciting horizon is unfolding for the School of Engineering – we are moving into the new $150M, state-of-the-art\nScience and Engineering Innovation Center\nin January 2024. Our new home will house 10 modern teaching labs, 7 shared research labs, 3 major facilities (including a strong wall and strong floor, an engine room, an HVAC training system, and a wind tunnel), 2 studio-style maker spaces, 1 student-training machine shop, computer labs, student spaces, and offices. These labs will provide hands-on, design-focused, and project-based education in robotics and mechatronics, edge computing and embedded systems, structural and seismic engineering, renewable energy systems, green materials technology, analog and digital electronics, power electronics, geotechnical engineering, design and manufacturing, and biomedical devices engineering. I am confident that when the new building opens in early 2024, it will allow our faculty and staff to bring our students’ educational experience to the next level.\nThank you for visiting SF State’s School of Engineering. Please join me in shaping the future of Engineering and STEM education by sharing your thoughts and ideas. By working together, we can change the world.\nGo Gators\n!\nKwok Siong Teh, Ph.D.\nProfessor and Director\nSchool of Engineering\nSan Francisco State University\nContact:\nksteh@sfsu.edu\nSupport the School",

She has been awarded donor-funded scholarships while pursuing her doctorate, and says SF State's donors “feel like extended family.”\nLearning has been a passion for\nAlfred Ceballos\never since he was a child in East Los Angeles, but he had to work through many challenges before becoming an undergraduate in the Lam Family College of Business. In this two-minute video, he tells his story and discusses the important impact that scholarships have had on his journey as a first-generation college student.\nDonate to Scholarships\nMake a huge impact on a student's life\nReceiving a scholarship can make a huge difference in students' ability to attend SF State and focus on their studies. One $1,000 scholarship provides the same financial support as 54 hours of minimum wage work in San Francisco — approximately the same investment of time needed for a student to take one class.\nThe diverse student body at San Francisco State University includes many students who are the first in their families to attend college. Making the University accessible through scholarships to students in need is a priority for the University. There are many established scholarship funds to support, from athletics to general needs. Many of our scholarships are endowed funds that grow over time to keep pace with the economy and raised tuition and fees.\nIn addition to supporting existing scholarship funds, some donors choose to establish\nnewly named scholarship endowments\n. Currently, a $200,000 endowment will generate enough income to cover most of a student's annual tuition, fees, and some living expenses. $25,000 is the minimum donation to establish any named endowed fund.\nEmail us\nto inquire about creating or funding a scholarship.\nEstablishing a scholarship fund\nThe assistance helps students focus on their studies and reduces the number of outside jobs they work, which can have a negative impact on graduation rates. To attract more scholarships, the University encourages alumni and friends to name these funds. Given students’ needs, the minimum to endow a named scholarship fund is $25,000—however, you may “adopt a student” by naming an annual current fund scholarship with a minimum donation of $5,000.\nPaying your donation over time\nPledged gifts are gratefully accepted and the University will make it easy by sending you pledge reminders at your request. Two-to three-year pledges are encouraged, and up to five years are allowed for $25,000 or more gifts.\nReceive information about your scholarship recipient\nProvided your donation is at the minimum level required to establish a named fund (see above), you will be informed about the recipients of your endowed scholarship. While some donors prefer to remain anonymous, and we work hard to ensure this for those who do, we encourage donors to let us publicize their identities to inspire others. Donors who identify themselves also have the opportunity to learn about the beneficiaries of their generosity. The University has scholarship and donor relations offices that work with scholarship recipients to assist them in personally acknowledging donors.\nDespite supporting himself and putting himself through college, scholarship recipient\nChristian Camaño\nis double-majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics for Advanced Study, with a minor in Anthropology, and is avidly pursuing a future as a researcher in applied mathematics. He’s also very proactive as a mentor and runs an online forum for 400+ San Francisco State math students.\nHassan Malik Russell,\na graduate student in the M.S. Counseling program, speaks about the financial and emotional impact of receiving a scholarship. Hassan currently works at a high school in Richmond, and is obtaining a master's degree to achieve his dream of becoming a school counselor.\nOlivia Gillett\n, recipient of the Scholarship for Diversity in Interior Design & Architecture, speaks about how winning and receiving the award changed her life in this inspiring video.\nErykah Butler\nloves being a special education preschool teacher in Oakland. Her experience as a graduate student in the Graduate College of Education is building on that experience and deepening her commitment to being a teacher. In 2023, she was awarded the Graduate College of Education Scholarship, which has had a big impact on her ability to pursue her educational journey.\nAt the start of his educational journey,\nDaniel Hernandez\njoined his father in working construction to pay tuition and bills. Today, he is an undergraduate in SF State's Bilingual Spanish Journalism program — the first program of its kind at a public university in the U.S. — focusing on producing journalism that is relevant to his community.

This season’s diverse lineup includes a cappella singers from Norway, a quintet of woodwind instruments and a San Francisco-based, Grammy-nominated piano duo. “A lot of people have never experienced chamber music or been to a concert,” said Richard Festinger, professor of Music and artistic director of the series. “In this area, like other metropolitan areas, it’s the symphony and opera that are well known to the general public. For a lot of people, chamber music may slip under their radar.

This CEL Initiative is possible due to systemwide collaboration and financial support from California’s Call to Service (CCS) initiative.\nAs part of this effort, the Institute for Civic and Community Engagement is working towards institutionalizing the faculty survey (\nCommunity Engagement Learning Attribute Tool - CELT\n) so that courses are periodically reviewed to ensure the attribute is relevant based on the student learning experience and partnerships happening within the course at the time of review. Our goal is to have this survey completed for 100% of unique CE/SL courses by May 2025.\nCommunity Engaged Learning Tool (CELT)\nOnce you have reviewed the CEL Essential Elements Taxonomy, begin taking the CELT for your course!\nTake the CELT\nDepartment Guide for Community Engaged Attribute\nThis document is a resource for departments and faculty on moving a course through Course Leaf\nSee Step by Step Guide\nCommunity Engaged Learning Essential Elements\nClick the link below to view the Community Engaged Learning Essential Elements Interactive Roadmap\nReview CEL Essential Elements\nHow to Complete the CELT Tutorial\nBrought to you by the CSU Center for Community Engagement\nCheck out Video\nFrequently Asked Questions\nAcademic Senate Policy\nAcademic Senate Policy #S22-224, Designation Policy for Community Service Learning Courses\nCurrent (supersedes Policy # S03-224) Senate Approval: 5/03/2022 [Presidential Approval: 5/06/22]\nAbstract\nThis policy seeks to provide definitions and policy, in accordance with guidance from the Chancellor’s Office, on the process for designating various types of community service or community-engaged courses.\nSummary\nAs part of the Chancellor’s Office (CO) 2018-19 California’s Call to Service Initiative, the CO identified an accountability goal to strengthen system-wide data collection infrastructure around community-engaged courses (as defined by the Chancellor's Office Center for Community Engagement). The purpose is to improve data collection to better support faculty and understand student learning, faculty efforts, and community impact. All campuses must implement two system-wide course attributes (community service learning and community-engaged learning) in the course management system to effectively identify and track these types of courses. Campuses are also required to distinguish service learning, as a distinct pedagogy, from community-engaged learning, which can include a variety of community-based learning experiences. A working group consisting of representatives from the Chancellor’s Office, CSU campuses, and the CSU Academic Senate developed the tools and resources needed for this initiative. The Institute for Civic and Community Engagement (ICCE) is overseeing this effort for San Francisco State University, including the dissemination, tracking, assessment, and reporting of the survey and survey data.\nCommunity service learning (CSL) and community-engaged learning (CEL) include a range of high-impact pedagogical practices that enhance students’ learning and foster civic understanding through active course-based learning that involves meaningful collaboration with community partners. The academic study may be in any discipline or combination of fields. Student learning outcomes benefit the common good, whether through direct service to communities in need or the organizations that serve them or through indirect service projects that contribute to community capacity building more broadly. CSL and CEL enhance academic learning by allowing students to make connections between their classroom education and its application to the field. These high-impact learning experiences help students to clarify their career goals and acquire work-related skills, develop a heightened sense of civic responsibility and awareness of moral and ethical issues, and provide them with a wide variety of work options with the goal of being value-added for the community they serve. Working from a common understanding will further the university’s identity as an “engaged institution,” contribute to quality transparent learning experiences for students, and offer opportunities for faculty dialogue and scholarship within and across disciplines.\nAcademic Senate Policy: Course Designation\n#S22-224 Academic Senate Policy\n362.96 KB\nHow are the Community-Engaged Learning (CEL) attributes being applied?\nThe attributes are applied in the student information system and based on a CEL Tool (CELT) that asks faculty about their teaching and community partnership\nii\npractices. The CELT is based on a\ncourse taxonomy for community- engaged learning\nwhich outlines the essential elements of these types of courses within a spectrum of implementation practices. Faculty complete a separate CELT for each course and the attribute is applied based on the faculty member’s responses.\nHow frequently will faculty be asked to complete the CELT?\nFaculty will need to complete a separate CELT for each CEL course they teach and should be completed at a minimum of every five years, but it may also be completed anytime there is a significant course change (i.e., a new CEL course developed, significant revisions to the CEL course or change in faculty member teaching the CEL course).\nWhat happens after a faculty member completes the CELT?\nFaculty members who complete the CELT will receive a Confirmation Email with your designated CEL attribute (either CCEL or CSLI). If more information is needed, ICCE will follow up with you.\nWhat if my course is already attributed as CSL?\nFor course that are currently listed as CSL, ICCE recommends faculty still take the\nCELT Survey\nand edit the designated community engagement course attribute if needed.\nWe acknowledge our faculty who have committed to teaching community-engaged learning courses and greatly appreciate current CSL faculty for completing the CELT tool. It is our intention to use the CELT results to enhance our services to provide faculty with resources to support community-based teaching and strengthen community partnerships. Furthermore, working from a common understanding will further the university’s identity as an “engaged institution,” contribute to quality transparent learning experiences for students, and offer opportunities for faculty dialogue and scholarship within and across disciplines.\nRelated Links\nCall to Service Grants\nCurrent List of CSL Courses\nStudent Community Placements\nCEL Attributes Guide for AOC/Dept.

    "content": "Thursday, September 13, 2018\nGOLDEN GATE XPRESS -- SF State is currently offering a course on the history of activism in sports, covering topics such as the impact of Jackie Robinson and current events such as the Colin Kaepernick controversy.\nTammy Forest and David Jaulus are leading the course. They strive to help students understand the impact athletes have on political and social issues.\nJaulus, an SF State graduate with a master’s degree in Political Science and an avid sports fan, feels that sports are held in high regard and give athletes a unique platform to express their opinion. Sports have a rich history of athletes being the focus of social issues, like Muhammad Ali refusing to be drafted and protesting the Vietnam War.\n“I hope we’re at the cutting edge of a revolution,” Jaulus said when talking about the amount of big name athletes such as LeBron James, Kaepernick and others speaking out and protesting issues they care about.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Monday, July 08, 2019\nASHARQ AL-AWSAT (LONDON) -- Iranian hard-liners have long mocked their foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, as the make-believe American, after a character in a comic Iranian movie who puts on an accent, wardrobe and lifestyle to live out a fantasy of American life.\nA resident of the United States on and off for nearly 30 years, Mr. Zarif was the Iranian most closely associated with the negotiation of the 2015 deal that limited Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for relief from sweeping economic sanctions. To ordinary Iranians and reformists, that made him a hero. To hard-liners, though, he was a dupe, seduced by the West into a deal that the Americans would never live up to. Now, with the nuclear deal on the brink of collapse, with the Trump administration reimposing crushing sanctions on Iran, and with Tehran threatening to restart elements of its nuclear program, Mr. Zarif is coming under renewed fire not only from hard-liners in Tehran but also from Washington.\nAt the top echelons of the Iranian political system, where knowledge of the United States is generally shallow and suspicions run deep, Mr. Zarif stands out for his ease among Americans. He came to the United States at 17 to attend college, and was an undergraduate at San Francisco State University in 1979 when the Islamic revolution broke out in Tehran. (He pitched in by helping lead a group of student revolutionaries who took over the Iranian consulate in San Francisco.)\nRead the full story\nFeed",

San Francisco State is about all of that,” Pelosi said. “So I’m proud to bring you greetings from the Congress with respect for you, for the students, for the families, with gratitude to all of you. And just one last thing: Go Gators!”\nPelosi was not the only elected official in attendance. Two members of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, Rafael Mandelman and Shamann Walton (MPA, ’10), were also on hand.\nMandelman said he is optimistic that today’s college students will graduate prepared to face the myriad challenges in society.\n“I, and the city and county of San Francisco, are grateful that you all have chosen to prepare to lead the students here into that non-dystopian future that we all hope remains achievable,” Mandelman said.\nWalton said he is proud to not only have graduated from SF State himself, but also to be the parent of two Gator alumni. He discussed the value of education as “the No. 1 thing that can never be taken away from us.”\n“As Malcolm X said, ‘Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today,’” Walton said. “Your work this year and continuing, of course, is preparing the brightest minds for success ... and [to] change the world.”\nIn her remarks, SF State President Lynn Mahoney highlighted SF State’s dedication to focusing on students.\n“I am deeply proud of the ways in which San Francisco State serves as a model of excellence in innovation in teaching, academic innovation and research,” Mahoney said. “Strengthening student learning is a priority for all here.”\nMahoney also noted the University remains committed to eliminating equity and opportunity gaps among underrepresented populations.\n“The greatest demonstration of our commitment to social justice starts here,” she said. “It starts at home by increasing the success of our students, especially our Black, Latinx, low-income and first-generation students.”\nOther speakers included: Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs Amy Sueyoshi, Professor of Biology and Academic Senate Chair Michael A. Goldman, Associated Students President Ersa Rao, California Faculty Association SF State Chapter President Brad Erickson, Staff Council Chair Dylan Mooney and CSU Employees Union SF State Chapter President Sandee Noda. The deans of SF State’s academic colleges and the University librarian introduced 34 new tenure-track faculty members.\nConvocation also featured an awards ceremony honoring distinguished faculty and staff, presented by Neda Nobari (B.S., ’84), board chair of the SF State Foundation.

But she’s devastated by the latest developments.\n“Conflict in the Middle East continues to destroy lives and perpetuate a cycle of violence and misunderstanding that never allows us to see each other, reach other, and tell a different story,” she says. “I feel a deep sorrow for my country, the U.S. and for the country of my extended family.\n“In Persian, when you are sad, you say, ‘I’ve eaten sorrow.’ I feel nothing but sorrow in my bones.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Prior to that he was assistant principal of the school for three years, and before that he taught there for three years. Chiala’s first teaching assignment was at Foothill High School in San Jose. Chiala, however, said he had not intended to be an educator. After obtaining a Bachelor’s degree in English at San Francisco State University, he managed restaurants at San Francisco’s Westin St. Francis Hotel. But Chiala felt something was missing. “I didn’t feel like I was making an impact on society,” he said. A friend told him about an opening at Foothill High School in East San Jose, a continuation school, where he would work with students who had been failing academically. His job was to help prepare them for taking the high school equivalency, or GED, test. “From the first day in the classroom, I knew it was what I wanted to do,” Chiala said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

She feels the pieces in the exhibit add the artists’ perspectives to what she learned in class. “In some pieces, it’s almost as if you’re looking from the outside in, and in others it’s like you’re looking from the inside out,” Kim said.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "SFSU earns prestigious Seal of Excelencia for its commitment to Latinx students\nAuthor:\nStrategic Marketing and Communications\nOctober 1, 2024\nThe seal recognizes SFSU for its leadership in meeting needs of Latinx students, advancing their talents\nSAN FRANCISCO (October 1, 2024) –\nSan Francisco State University\nhas earned the prestigious Seal of Excelencia granted by\nExcelencia in Education\n, the nation’s premier authority on efforts to accelerate Latinx student success in higher education. The Seal is a national certification for institutions that strive to more intentionally serve Latinx students.\nSan Francisco State is one of 17 colleges and universities to earn the Seal in 2024. In 2018, Excelencia introduced the Seal to certify trendsetting colleges and universities for their efforts to become learning environments where Latinx, and all, students thrive. This year marks the organization’s 20th year of service to accelerate Latinx student success in higher education.\nThe Seal of Excelencia framework\nrepresents a rigorous assessment of certified institutions’ intentionality and impact. It assesses the institutions’ outcomes in retention, financial support and degree completion for Latinx students through the alignment of data, practice and leadership. Seal certification remains valid for three years, after which institutions can recertify progress.\n“We are deeply honored to receive the Seal of Excelencia for our steadfast commitment to advancing the talents of Latinx students,” SFSU President Lynn Mahoney said. “Here at SF State, we understand the importance of providing an environment where students’ identities are celebrated and represented in their education. Earning the Seal reflects that.”\nThis year’s cohort of newly certified and recertified institutions belongs to a collective of 46 colleges and universities that have earned the Seal. Together, they represent less than 1% of all institutions but enroll 17% and graduate 19% of all Latinx students nationwide.\nSpecifically at SFSU, Latinx student enrollment doubled between 2010 and 2022. More than 39% of students identify as Latinx, making them the largest ethnic group among the University’s undergraduates.\n“The colleges and universities that earn the Seal of Excelencia lead the charge in meeting our nation’s degree attainment goals,” said Deborah Santiago, co-founder and CEO of Excelencia\nof Education. “They demonstrate commitment to Latino student success through impact and ongoing self-assessment.”\nHigher education, business, philanthropy and government leaders in Excelencia’s community convened in Washington, D.C., to recognize SFSU as one of eight institutions that earned the Seal of Excelencia for the first time, as well as nine other institutions that earned recertification. The announcement was part of the organization’s National Policy Forum, focused on innovating policies to accelerate Latinx degree attainment and strengthen our country’s civic leadership and workforce. The 17 Seal-certified institutions exemplify the kinds of programs and practices that inform good policy.\nBefore SFSU earned the Seal of Excelencia, President Mahoney joined Excelencia’s national network of\nPresidents for Latino Student Success (P4LSS)\n. The network comprises over 200 higher education leaders committed to making their institutions learning environments where Latinx, and all, students thrive. Institutions in the P4LSS network are eligible to apply for the Seal. To earn the Seal of Excelencia, they must demonstrate:\nAn intentional, institutional focus on advancing Latinx student success by aligning data and practice\nDeliberate and ongoing assessment to identify and implement strategies that improve Latinx student achievement\nLeadership commitment to continue transforming into an environment where Latinx students thrive\nA long-term and unwavering commitment to intentionally serve Latinx, and all, students.\nFor example, SFSU is conducting targeted outreach efforts aimed at bolstering retention and degree completion rates among Latinx students. Much of this work is part of the California State University’s Equity Priority directives, which aim to eliminate equity gaps. Re-enrollment and re-engagement campaigns are also a priority with cross-campus units working to help our Latinx students who have dropped out return.\n“Students and families as well as leaders in philanthropy, business and government look to colleges and universities that earned the Seal of Excelencia when making their institutional choices,” said Sarita Brown, co-founder and president of Excelencia in Education. “Excelencia is proud to partner with institutions ensuring America’s bright future by advancing the talents of the Latino community.”\nInterested in becoming a San Francisco State University student?

It is, indeed, the gift that keeps giving.\n“I never could have imagined this,” says the El Cerrito native, who assumed the role in 2005 on “The Closer,” which ran for seven seasons before spawning its spin-off. “When you’re an actor — especially an actor of color — anything longer than two weeks is cause for celebration.”\nAs a teen growing up in the East Bay, Chan’s first love was music. He and his pals formed a rock band that did gigs at high school dances and frat parties. But by the time he reached San Francisco State, he was bitten by the acting bug.\nFour decades later, Chan’s résumé features more than 300 episodes of television and 35 feature-film roles.\nPhoto by Eddy Chen/TNT\nRead the full story\nFeed",

She’s one of 23 CSU students to receive the CSU Trustee Award for Outstanding Achievement, the highest academic honor given annually by the CSU to students from each campus.\nAs a future educator, she wants to help young people unlearn oppressive thinking and behaviors. “After taking Women and Gender Studies courses, I began to understand the systemic nature of violence,” said Madenokoji. “Being an educator, I want to help students gain that analytical lens to navigate this complex world.”\nSan Francisco State Associate Professor of English Summer Star, a former professor of Madenokoji’s, says there couldn’t be a more deserving candidate for the award. Because of the flexibility it offers students, the CSU attracts people at different junctures in their lives and careers. “It’s a place for people who are self-starters and self-motivators,” she said. “Yuri is the poster child of self-motivation. The challenges she’s faced make her achievements and her tenacity all the more exceptional.”\nMadenokoji wants to use education to uplift people, specifically marginalized groups. “She’s interested in teaching in a way that empowers students, no matter their background, and to instill a belief that they are a power for good. And that begins with feeling worthy,” Star added.\nGrowing up, Madenokoji says she didn’t know how to talk about difficult subjects like racism or sexism. She just didn’t have the language for it. But after studying feminist theory, she saw the world in a new way. She saw how marginalized people have been harmed by invisible systems, like white supremacy and sexism. It’s a revelation she’d like to share with her students.\nPeople aren’t born racist or sexist, she says. These ideas are learned and internalized. “It’s our responsibility to undo the system of oppression. Otherwise we are complicit in it,” she said. “The first step in breaking out of the cycle of oppression is to put a name to it.”\nShe plans to use literature as a gateway for exploring some of these topics and for helping students understand what’s happening in the world right now, she says, whether it’s social, political or economic. “And then from there we can talk about what we can do in our own lives to work toward justice,” she said. “I want to be the kind of teacher who doesn’t just teach the current curriculum but also nurtures the heart and soul of students.”\n— Jamie Oppenheim\nNews Article",

We were in a sketch group together with a fourth member, Gabriel Diani — now he’s an independent filmmaker, I’ve done a couple of his movies and he’s a genius. But Gabe took time off to go do a one-man show, and we decided to organize a festival, so that we had more of an opportunity to do a long set of sketch in San Francisco. There weren’t a lot of venues that allowed for that or were made for that. ...\n“By the time I moved to San Francisco I had sort of pragmatized my way out of thinking I would be a performer for a living. But my friends at SF State, Dave, Cole, and Gabe, cajoled me into being in the sketch group that they were forming. And I’m so glad they did. It was really the first time that I had officially done comedy. I loved doing funny plays and stuff like that, but I wasn’t one of those kids that got involved with an improv group in high school.

We will also strengthen outreach to K–12 students with IDD, their families, educators, and community stakeholders by hosting showcases and speaking events that highlight the achievements of IPP students as well as provide opportunities for other students with IDD to envision themselves being college students.\nRelated News\nESN Professor, Mayumi Hagiwara awarded 2 Grants!\nOctober 3, 2025\nA Summer of Impactful Collaboration\nSeptember 19, 2025\nCalifornia Deaf Blind Services (CDBS) at risk of being defunded!\nJune 29, 2025\nInclusion Pilot Project is hiring Peer Mentors for Fall 2025!\nApril 29, 2025",

Your technique all comes from your torso rotating and de-rotating, while using your legs to give power to your stroke. It really gets your heart rate up and it’s amazing fun.

Many are the first generation in their family to go to college. ...\nA mural of Harvey Milk, either to replace Edward Said or to be displayed adjacent, would be a positive proactive step we in the Jewish community should support.

Marc Stein, the Jamie and Phyllis Pasker Professor of History, discusses these historic events. “When, for example, the gay movement adopted the slogan ‘Gay is Good,’ it was clearly based on ‘Black is Beautiful,’” Stein says. “And the Stonewall Riots themselves in 1969 — to me although there’s a gap, chronologically, between the Watts rebellion and the Stonewall Riots — there were summer riots across the United States in Black communities leading up to 1969. And so, it seems clear that that was a direct inspiration for Stonewall.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Students can get involved in the music scene by joining SFSU’s student-run radio station, KSFS, or complete the Music/Recording Industry certificate.

Photo by Jena Osman.\nFourteen Hills: The SFSU Review, the national literary journal published in the Creative Writing Department, has established the Stacy Doris Memorial Poetry Award, in memory of the late faculty member, poet and translator.\nThe call for entries states a desire to honor a poem with a truly inventive spirit: “Doris was always creating new worlds with her unexpected poetics, following upon that spirit of creative invention and inventive creation, engaging wit and ingenious playfulness, discovery in construction and radical appropriations based on classical forms, pastiche and love.”\nStacy Doris was an associate professor of creative writing for 10 years. Her work is widely recognized. Her recent posthumous collection,\nFledge: A Phenomenology of Spirit\n(Nightboat Books) was described as  “a miracle of attentiveness” by department Chair Maxine Chernoff.\nDoris’ other books include\nParamour\n,\nThe Cake Part, Knot\n,\nCheerleader’s Guide to the World: Council Book\n,\nConference\n,\nUne Année à New York avec Chester\n,\nLa vie de Chester Steven Wiener ecrite par sa femme and\nKildare\n. She was also a translator, known for her work with contemporary French poetry. She co-edited two anthologies,\nTwenty One New (to North America) French Writers\nand Violence of the White Page\n, with Emmanuel Hocquard.\nThe poetry award winner will receive $500 and publication in the spring 2014 issue of Fourteen Hills. Poems not awarded will still be considered for publication. Poet Chet Wiener, Doris’ husband, will serve as guest judge. Submissions must be received by January 1 through\nFourteen Hills’ Submittable site\n. Poems must be no more than 10 pages. Only one poem per author may be submitted. Current SF State students are ineligible.\nStaffed exclusively by Creative Writing graduate students, Fourteen Hills: The SFSU Review publishes original poetry, fiction, literary nonfiction and cross-genre work created by writers in the U.S. and abroad. It also welcomes and prints representative contributions from visual artists. Founded in 1994, Fourteen Hills contributes to a vibrant literary tradition on the West Coast centered in the Bay Area. Its commitment to presenting a diversity of experimental and progressive work by emerging and cross-genre writers, as well as by award-winning and established authors, has earned it a reputation for literary excellence. Being independent means its aesthetic is dynamic and fluid, ever changing to meet the needs of the culture and the historical moment as the staff perceive them. As an international literary magazine, Fourteen Hills has developed a reading audience that goes beyond the San Francisco Bay Area to the international community.

As a child, she moved from England to Switzerland to Los Angeles as her father, the scientist Edward De Robertis, built his career. Coming to the U.S. when she was 10, “from other countries that were not my country of origin,” she says, “I had this feeling and experience of having a country inside my skin that wasn’t outside my skin.”\nShe went on to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, and moved to the Bay Area in 1997. “I bounced around between San Francisco and Berkeley, following the lower rents at the time, working at different activist jobs, and as a substitute teacher. And then I had this very formative experience in my mid-20s when I was about to marry a woman, the love of my life, with whom I’ve had these two children, and my parents disowned me. One of the things that they said was that I couldn’t be Uruguayan anymore, because I was gay. Because I didn’t exist in their country.\n“When I was younger, back when I was writing that first novel, I thought I’d never feel at home anywhere in the world. I thought belonging was just something that would never be fully possible for me,” De Robertis says. “But I’ve built a life in the Bay Area with my wife and kids and with chosen family, and a community that we have forged where there is room for all of us. Because there’s enough openness and possibility for families like mine.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

Longmore Institute on Disability at San Francisco State University proudly announces\nEmerge\n, a three-year initiative made possible thanks to a generous $1 million grant from the Mellon Foundation. This support will allow the Longmore Institute to lead a month-long July workshop for 10 emerging Disability Studies scholar-activists, held three consecutive summers at San Francisco State University with an option for hybrid participation.\nEmerge seeks to promote scholar-activism: the bridges and relationships that allow academics and activists to better support each other in the shared pursuit of social change. This initiative will cultivate relationships among the next generation of Disability Studies leaders, further diversify the conversation, and promote more scholar-activism in the field.\nEach Emerge cohort will consist of scholars, artists, cultural producers, filmmakers, or activists whose work enriches the field of Disability Studies with projects that explore disabled people’s experiences intersecting with further marginalization by race, gender, sexuality, incarceration, or immigration. Each group of ten will be invited to SFSU’s campus from across the U.S. on the basis of their 4-5 years’ experience in disability-related scholarship, arts/culture/filmmaking, and/or disability justice activism. They will receive support for working on new projects grounded in scholar-activism, an assigned mentor, and opportunities to meet with the Bay Area’s disability arts, rights, and justice organizations. Throughout the month, we will facilitate conversations for the Emerge fellows with local disabled changemakers about what scholar-activism means to them and the challenges they face in their work today. The summer will culminate in a hybrid-model symposium presenting the Emerge fellows' work to the broader Disability Studies community.\nKey details of Emerge fellowship:\n$10,000 July Stipend to support your own personal project in scholar-activism and associated costs with the fellowship. Additional funding for travel/lodging/meal plan for your stay at SFSU with accessible dorm accommodations provided. If you cannot join us in person because of safety or accommodation needs, a digital means of participation will be provided.\nProject mentor to be provided, including weekly meetings during July and monthly meetings for ten months following the Emerge workshop.\nFor an example of who we are hoping to support,\nsee the Ford Foundation’s Disability Futures Fellows\nand know that applicants with similar levels of accomplishments to the Ford Futures Fellows would likely be turned away. Rather, we are seeking people who have the passion and ideas to grow into precisely these sorts of leaders but aren't there yet and would benefit from the Emerge opportunity to help them move in that direction.\nAccommodation support for your participation (if you’d like to discuss your specific needs before applying, contact\nbeitiks@sfsu.edu\n. We will look forward to working with you to make this program accessible and have budgeted for ASL, live captioning, and some financial support for personal care assistant needs).\nThe schedule will be determined in collaboration with the selected fellows and their access needs. Fellows will be expected to be available each weekday for a 3-4 hour synchronous meeting, including a bio-break. In addition, this commitment will include time for independent work on your proposed project as well as occasional additional meetups for excursions (performances, museums, etc, alway hybrid participation possible). Once the workshop concludes, fellows agree to participate in monthly one-hour check in calls with Emerge cohort from August to May 2024, time TBD based on cohort availability.\nAll applicants must identify as disabled and be working in an area that centers on disability intersections with race, gender, sexuality, incarceration record, and/or immigration status.\nFellows will be selected by a four-member selection committee bringing together people with disabilities who represent the similarly diverse fields that we are hoping our Emerge cohort will represent. Fellows will be selected based on their past accomplishments, proposed individual projects, expressed commitment to scholar-activist practice, and the perceived impact from participation in the Emerge opportunity.\nYou can find a list of frequently asked questions and answers providing more guidance on the application questions and Emerge opportunity here.

    "title": "Philosophy Professor Jacob Needleman Gives Himself Spiritual Pep Talk in New Book",
    "content": "Thursday, November 10, 2016\n“Among the great questions of the human heart, none is more central than the question, ‘Who am I?’” Jacob Needleman approaches meaningful material with frankness in the introduction of his most recent book,\nI Am Not I\n(North Atlantic Books). A professor of philosophy at SF State for more than 50 years, Needleman tackles life’s existential mysteries through a unique dialogue between his 82-year-old self and his younger counterparts at progressing ages, offering them the illuminating wisdom he has amassed over decades of pursuit.\nHow does rejecting our certainties liberate us? What does inner consciousness truly mean? Needleman acts as guiding counselor to his young self, Jerry, who seeks answers to these questions in the author’s shortest title on profound concepts to date.\nI Am Not I\nis a departure from Needleman’s previous tomes on philosophy due to its feasible-for-teens language and arrangement into play form. A graduate of Harvard University, Yale University and University of Freiburg, he pioneered an in-depth study on diverse, alternative faiths in his landmark text,\nThe New Religions\n, published in 1970. The Harvard Bulletin called it “a vital study of a phenomenon that has dramatically altered the lives of those it has touched.” He has written 20 books on philosophy, life purpose and God, but\nI Am Not I\nis his most personal achievement yet.\n“This book I wanted to be for the younger generation,” Needleman says, “so I started writing it to my students but suddenly I started writing to me. I was once young. And I started writing it as a dialogue between me, a grown man of 82, and Jerry, which was my nickname when I was 14.”\nThroughout\nI Am Not I\n, Jacob eagerly incites Jerry to think less with his intellectual brain and feel more with his metaphysical mind, to reach higher levels of enlightenment. Stage and camera directions scatter the dialogue, providing an atmospheric tone.\nWhile Needleman says some consider philosophy to be “logical, analytic, dry and reductive,” he emphasizes the ever-present need for questioning one’s beliefs and ideologies.\n“You can never exhaust the ideas of philosophy,” he says. “Philosophy at its root is about how to live, not just how to think. The world is always changing; truth has to be worked for. You have to make real truth your own. Our deeper truths are never old; they’re always discovered.”\nNeedleman explains that his courses must attend to the appetite of the soul, “or whatever you want to call it,” he quips. Philosophy, as he proposes, should feed a “sharp, clever, analytical mind as well as a deep metaphysical heart.”\nIndependent thought is a tenet of his teaching ideology. One of his most memorable moments as a teacher happened when a student said, “You really want us to think for ourselves, don’t you? No one else does.” Needleman recalls the earnestness in her voice as one of the most beautiful things he had ever heard.\nBy bringing age-old questions into modern conversation, Needleman aims to be a catalyst for the consciousness he believes all human beings yearn to awaken at some point in their lives. For many, the hunger for greater knowledge begins as young as 14 and peaks during college. This insatiable curiosity in young people initially drew Needleman to teach at SF State in 1962. Needleman finds that the longing for deeper contemplation, and the innate struggle between the logical and metaphysical, has not waned in his students since then.\n“Whatever I have to give, it’s needed. If I don’t try to transmit what [understanding] I have, what I have will be taken from me,” he says. “When I feel there’s a real need for what I’ve learned, especially within the students, I discover that, somehow, from somewhere, I am given a little bit of something like wisdom.”\nBut after 50 years of imparting knowledge, what have his students taught him about learning? Needleman surprises even himself with his answer. “The fundamental character trait for teaching is the ability to listen. ‘What’s behind the question?’ ‘Who are they?’ Listening is the vibration in the exchange between us.”\nNeedleman is technically retired, but still teaches at SF State every other semester as he considers young adults the most vital investment. He plans to teach a class this spring. He is also in early talks to adapt\nI Am Not I\nfor the screen.\nWhen asked what he looks forward to in the rest of his life, he replies, “More and more of what I have done. More and more attempts to communicate to others what I have been fortunate enough to receive. The more of that, the better.”\n—Gospel Cruz\nLinks\nI Am Not I\non Amazon\nJacob Needleman\nPhilosophy Department\nPhoto: Jacob Needleman in his home office. Photo by Gospel Cruz.\nNews Article",

The book is informed by personal experience and observation, but DeAndreis said he bears little resemblance to his protagonist. “He’s a little more easily defeated than I am.” “There are profound differences between being a sub and being a full-time teacher,” said DeAndreis. “Being a sub, you have to work less, and you have to have a better sense of humor. If you get used to kids trying to take little advantages like getting out early, telling you, ‘Oh, we don’t have to do this work,’ then you can have fun with them and laugh it off.” For DeAndreis, working as a sub and coaching baseball at his alma mater, Lowell High School, facilitates his ability to pursue writing as he attends night classes at SF State.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

The documentary will explore five ancient Judeo-Christian monuments in Iran to promote cultural harmony in an effort to dispel narratives of fear, exclusion and mistrust. The documentary is centered on inclusive, diverse and equitable narrative and constructivist frameworks in search of common cultural heritage and similarities between Judeo-Christian, Iranian and Islamic architecture, art, aesthetics and culture.\n“I am excited about this project and thankful to both the college committee and the LCA leadership for giving me the opportunity to highlight our common humanities despite all the noise promoting otherness and us against them mentality through my project,” says Khani. “This project is an attempt to contribute to our diverse, yet similar, stories and experiences in line with the LCA's mission ‘to find collective solutions to pressing global and social issues.’”\nJohnny Symons\n“Get Your 10s” is a feature-length documentary planned by Associate Professor of Cinema Johnny Symons that follows Rashaad Newsome, a Black queer artist from the American South, as he creates his most ambitious project yet: a multi-platform, experiential performance at New York City’s Park Avenue Armory. Complete with a 30-foot hologram, a gospel choir, the premier vogue dancers from the US, Japan, Brazil, and Ukraine, and a spirited non-binary artificial intelligence named Being, Rashaad transforms a historic military building into a sanctuary for healing and celebration. In the process, he reveals how art and ballroom culture can help us collectively imagine a brighter future.\n“In the wake of the pandemic and a difficult economy, it’s an especially challenging time to complete a feature-length documentary and this award provides me with the ability to dig deeply into crafting this important story. At a time when LGBTQ+ lives are being increasingly denigrated and legislated, this film showcases the talents of queer, trans and BIPOC artists and dancers and inspires us to use our imaginations to work towards a more equitable world,” says Symons. “The time and funds afforded by this award will go directly towards editing, finishing and releasing the film in festivals and streaming services, with the collaborative support of SFSU students and recent alums.”\nYutian Wong\n“Dancing in the Archives of Sincerity” is a book planned by Theatre & Dance Professor Yutian Wong about the intersection of a global health crisis, the resurgence of anti-Asian racism, and dance studies. Using the Korean pop music act BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondon) as a case study, the book examines how conversations about racism/xenophobia, homophobia, cultural hierarchies, and the roles and responsibilities of the artist in society are taking place from the space of Asian popular culture.\n“How dance is produced, performed, and taught changed overnight when theaters, studios, and other public spaces closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to Professor Wong. “Long-held assumptions about dance and how to conduct dance research were completely upended, so my book is a response to teaching about dance and doing dance research in the aftermath of a global health crisis. This Marcus Transformative Research Award affords me the time to reflect on this massive disciplinary shift and complete the book manuscript.”\nAbout the The Marcus Transformative Research Award\nThe Marcus Transformative Research Award\nprovides one semester leave with pay and a $3,000 research budget. The award is made possible by the George and Judy Marcus Funds for Excellence in the Liberal Arts, which was established in 2018 with a $25-million gift to SF State.\nSF State alum executive produces documentary on hoops legend Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nRead more\nabout SF State alum executive produces documentary on hoops legend Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\nSarah Allen (B.A., ’99) focuses her journalism work on social justice in sports\nTwo decades before Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the National Anthem to protest police violence, another professional athlete faced severe consequences for refusing to salute the flag. Now, a San Francisco State University alumna has brought former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf’s unique story — and the tantalizing style he played the game — to an international audience.\nLongtime journalist Sarah Allen (B.A., ’99) is an executive producer for\n“STAND,”\nthe biographical documentary about Abdul-Rauf featuring extensive interviews with him and other basketball luminaries. It premiered on Showtime on Feb. 3.\n“I fell into it because I really was intrigued by that whole conversation around athletes and activism,” Allen said. “I’m not as interested in giving somebody’s stats on the field. That’s boring to me. Athletes have stories that go beyond that.”\nBorn as Chris Jackson in 1969 in Mississippi, Abdul-Rauf exhibited a dazzling display of skills and athleticism at only 6 feet and 1 inch tall. He used his battle with Tourette syndrome as motivation. “It looked like I was watching God play basketball,” Shaquille O’Neal, a teammate of Abdul-Rauf at Louisiana State University, said in the documentary. Allen said: “Clearly, he was Steph Curry before Steph Curry.”\nAbdul-Rauf’s career was cut short, however, after he decided to sit on the bench during pregame performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” due to the continued oppression of Black people in America. He was suspended and then exiled from the league, and later his home was burned down in an act of white supremacy. Now age 54, he has enjoyed a career resurgence, dominating players much younger than him in the half-court BIG3 basketball league with the same skills he has always had.\n“Mahmoud is just very layered,” Allen said. “When you see his story, he’s had a lot of trauma in his life. When you look at him, he doesn’t seem like he’s been through everything he’s been through. And that is what intrigued me. And again, he’s a conduit for all these messages that are in the film and that I feel we should continue talking about.”\nAllen met Abdul-Rauf at the 2017 National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference, where he won an award. At the time, he was long out of the national spotlight and his story had been largely forgotten. Allen approached him and convinced him to do an interview, his first one-on-one with anyone in years. Their rapport has since evolved into Allen writing numerous stories on Abdul-Rauf and then negotiating his licensing agreement with Showtime and the contract for his 2022 memoir through Kaepernick Publishing.\nAllen’s SF State story\nAllen grew up in the Fillmore District in San Francisco. After high school at Sacred Heart Cathedral, she attended Clark Atlanta University for one year before returning to the Bay Area.\n“San Francisco State has one of the best broadcasting programs in the country, so it was a no-brainer for me,” she said.\nBy Allen’s third semester, though, she found herself on academic probation. She credits fellow Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts student Tiffany Griffith (B.A., ’99) with helping turn her academic career around.\n“She and I became fast friends and we started taking classes together. I started getting motivated to go to class, be awake during class, make sure I do my homework,” Allen said. “I think it took me about a year and a half to get off academic probation. And in a year and a half, I ended up back on the Dean’s List.\n“Once I really took it seriously, the mentors that I had there, they really made sure I succeeded,” Allen added. “And I’m just so grateful I had that experience because it really prepared me for real life.”\nLearn more about the SF State Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department.\nAlum directs ‘The Murder Inc. Story’ docuseries on BET, and it’s a hit\nRead more\nabout Alum directs ‘The Murder Inc. Story’ docuseries on BET, and it’s a hit\nSF State helped Michael J. Payton develop his love for hip-hop into a career\nWhen San Francisco State University graduate Michael J. Payton posted a YouTube video about hip-hop record label Murder Inc. four years ago, he didn’t expect it would get him hired as director of the official docuseries for national television. But it did.\n“The Murder Inc. Story”\npremiered on Black Entertainment Television (BET) on Aug. 9 and hit No. 3 trending on Twitter. Payton (B.A., ’15) directed all five of the one-hour episodes and interviewed icons such as Ja Rule, Jay-Z, Nas and Daymond John.\nIn early 2019, label founder Irv “Gotti” Lorenzo posted an all-points bulletin to his 1 million Instagram followers: “Whoever knows Michael Payton. Let him know to reach out to me. ‘Cause I am gonna let him be [a part] of the Big Official Documentary.”\nThat same night, they connected over the phone and Gotti tapped Payton to direct the series.\nMurder Inc. recording artists like Ja Rule, Ashanti and Lloyd dominated the charts in the early 2000s, shattering Guinness World Records. Federal money laundering charges against Gotti and his brother would contribute to a fast downfall, though they were acquitted. The music retains legacy and influence, as it has for Payton since age 12.\n“I remember being enamored with their mystique and the whole brand,” said Payton, who grew up in Oakland. “It’s really a story of hope [and] belief in oneself. That’s one of the things I’m most fascinated by with hip-hop culture. It was all from the minds of very young people who had nothing. If you believe and have a passion and work hard, you can change the world.”\nAn SF State vibe\nAfter high school, Payton selected SF State for its audio production and music recording program in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts (BECA) Department. He discovered a hip-hop community that would not only shape his career, but also provide him with a deep scholarly understanding of the genre that he loves.\nHe took Africana Studies courses with\nDawn-Elissa Fischer\n, an anthropologist renowned for her research of hip-hop and other aspects of Black popular culture.\n“He is a great communicator and peer educator,” Fischer said. “He created pathways and opportunities for many students, and he has continued to do so for those who came to SF State after him.”\nIn the\nAfricana Studies Department’s\nHip-Hop Workshop course, he served as assistant to Fischer and\nDave “Davey D” Cook\n. Davey D and Payton reunited for “The Murder Inc. Story,” where Davey D appears as a historian.\n“[Including him in the docuseries] was one of my proudest moments,” Payton said. “He was a big anchor for a lot of the cultural context in this story, and BET just loved him and his contribution.”\nCommuting from Antioch, Payton would arrive on campus early in the morning and stay as late as possible. He was active in the\nBlack Student Union\nand was general manager of student radio station\nKSFS\nand booked shows at\nThe Depot\n. His weekly “Turn Up at The Depot” event allowed student rappers (including himself), DJs and bands to perform alongside notable artists. He was having the time of his life and recorded an EP titled “19th and Holloway.”\n“There’s nothing like walking from Parkmerced to Stonestown late on a Friday night with your friends,” he said. “I wanted to capture that vibe in that EP. To this day, I still go back and listen to it and feel the same feels that I felt back then.”\nThe takeover\nA scholarship from Jay-Z’s\nShawn Carter Foundation\nhelped make it possible for Payton to attend SF State. When they met for an interview for “The Murder Inc. Story,” Jay-Z was so excited that he called his mother when the cameras stopped rolling: “Mom, look at this young man who we put through school! He is now working with BET!’”\nPayton is now working on a project for the Shawn Carter Foundation’s 20th anniversary. Payton is also slated to direct a docuseries about women’s contributions to hip-hop and executive produce a documentary about jailed drug lord Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff.\nPayton emphasizes that he aims for all of his work to be a catalyst for change and community involvement. “I always want to make sure we’re able to weave in things that are going to start necessary conversations,” said Payton, who earned his master’s degree from New York University and served as an executive fellow for the governor’s California Volunteers initiative. “It’s not just these people [who] made cool music and this cool thing they did. No, let’s also dig deeper into these stories of why and how and give that cultural context.”\nLearn more about the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts Department\n.\nSubscribe to Broadcast and Electronic Arts",

And for almost all that time he’s been heavily involved in theater, majoring in it as an undergraduate, directing with the Seventh Army Repertory Company while serving as a radio operator in a field artillery observation battalion. And getting his Master’s in theatre at San Francisco State. His theatre company, Multi Ethnic, or MET for short, grew directly out of his “umpteen years” teaching with the San Francisco Unified School District. For much of that time he ran a district-wide Center for Theater Training, a program that became part of the School of the Arts high school when it was founded, where he was “the actor training teacher until I retired in 1993.”\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Superfest Spotlight: A Q&A with the Filmmaker of Reasonable Adjustment\nAuthor:\nLongmore Institute\nSeptember 22, 2021\nIn the 1980s a disabled terror group reasonable adjustment carried out a campaign of violence to gain rights - or did they?\nOur Longmore Student Fellow Nathan Burns interviewed Justin Edgar, director of\nReasonable Adjustment\n, which will screen at #Superfest35, October 15-17. Read on and make sure to\nreserve your pass to Superfest now.\nNathan: What inspired you to create\nReasonable Adjustment\n?\nJustin:\nFirst and foremost, the thing to make sure all potential programmers know is that the film is not real. It is entirely a constructed fiction made with actors, digital effects, different film stocks and sound techniques of the period and some deepfake footage of real people. There is a lot of invisible effects work in this film.\nAs a filmmaker, I find mock documentary films don’t really convince so I set the challenge of convincing myself. I had to go to great lengths to do that. It wasn’t easy to do and everything in the film had to be recreated. I made microfiche newspaper articles, burned the chair for real and hired a professional reportage photographer to shoot 35mm ektachrome stills, these photographs were then shot on a 16mm rostrum camera exactly as would have been done back then – you can’t just do that anywhere. We had to source period props, costumes and digitally remove anything that didn’t belong in frame. There is a lot of invisible CGI in the film. We also went to a home office registered firing range in Yorkshire to recreate the attack on the BBC using live ammunition. To get the right locations we had to shoot in the Midlands, Birmingham and various locations in London including a guerrilla shoot in Westminster. We also had to find a voice double for Margaret Thatcher.\nWe shot on 16mm film with an Arriflex camera that would have been used at the time. We used vintage lenses and old-fashioned tungsten lighting. We made the sound mix mono and used special sound filters to ensure it sounded of the period. I auditioned many actors to get someone with the right inflection of a presenter from the 1990s. This authenticity also extended to the accessibility features of the film and it has old-style Ceefax subtitles.\nPart of making it work was the tone – I decided it should have a slightly left-wing journalistic bias which would help to ensure that it felt real. Many British TV programmes of the time had that stance and World in Action is how filmmakers like Paul Greengrass started out. If you look back at old docos from that period they are very mannered and slow as well and we tried to emulate that style.\nI realised that pre-2000AD we were BG (before google) and truth BG is hazy, you can make stuff up. For instance, in 1997 I was involved in quite a big news story, it made national press at the time but it’s nowhere to be found online. For all intents and purposes it doesn’t exist. Before Google is the dark ages in terms of what really happened. Another example is the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) who were very active, and are kind of the model for RAD. They sent letter bombs, killed and even branded people with branding irons, but you never hear anything about them now.\nI have a theory about protest groups – they assimilate the tropes of other, past protest groups, so are quite easy to recreate and emulate. Putin has done this to great effect in Russia to steer and influence public opinion.\nI believe we are living in a post-truth era, whether we like it or not. I also believe that truth is relative and a subjective concept, we all live in our own realities and cinema reflects that. Susan Sontag spoke of humankind revelling in “mere images of the truth”.\nNathan: For our mostly US-based audience, can you share a bit more about the cultural context of disability in relation to radicalism in the UK? Relatedly, was there any significance to the fact that you borrowed footage from the IRA?\nJustin:\nI think outside the UK we have an image as a polite little island, but its actually always been a hotbed of anti-establishment movements. The French called it a revolution but we call ours a civil war! From the Tolpuddle martyrs to Punk to Brexit, there is a long history of dissent, its in the DNA of the British. I grew up in the Thatcher 80s, a very febrile era of mistrust where peace activits and trade unionists were under mass surveillance by the state and the spectre of IRA violence hung over everything – there were metal detectors in my local library and bombings were common. I think a lot of that went into Reasonable Adjustment.\nAccording to the British Medical Journal there have been 130,000 preventable deaths attributable to the austerity policies of the Liberal Democrat and Conservative government of David Cameron and Nick Clegg since 2010.\nErrol Graham, 57, weighed 28.5kg when he starved to death after complications owing to the nature of his disability led to his benefits being cut. He died having pulled out his own teeth with a pair of pliers as he didn’t have the appropriate care.\nThese are holocaust-like numbers more associated with war than social policy and people need a mirror held up to the society we are living in. A society where disabled and disadvantaged people have been disregarded and vilified by a government which we voted in. This is life and death, it’s a big subject and the work needs to be impactful”.\nThat is why I compare the struggle for disability rights to other armed resistance groups with RAD. I wanted to compare the two and draw parallels.\nNathan: What’s the biggest take-away you hope audiences will get from your film?\nJustin:\nIf we start with the notion that truth is tyranny, we can understand the film better. I appreciate not everyone will agree with that assertion, but there’s no point in making a film if it doesn’t cause debate. Whenever you point a camera at something you are making a judgement about how you see that thing, staking your own sense of truth upon it.\nWho is the arbiter of what’s real and what isn’t? Yourself? Can you trust yourself?\nMy reality may not be your reality.\nAnother important point is that this is satire and people have to remember that, it’s meant to make a point through humour. When I put a teaser clip of the film on Facebook it was viewed 80,000 times in 24 hours and was banned by facebook for hate speech. I always felt it was interesting for people to find their own truth about what they are watching, good or bad. After an appeal it was reinstated as it makes a comment on hate speech rather than extolling it.\nThe key question that I hope viewers will ask is why make it up? Why bother? And that question prompts you to delve a bit deeper. I encourage programmers to let audiences make up their own mind about the film. I always knew there was a risk that people would get offended if they felt stupid, that they’d been duped. But then I thought in that realisation there will be an insight where people think about the issues at hand…\nNathan: At Superfest, we often talk about disability being a creative and generative force in filmmaking. Rather than the \"in spite of your disability\" stories, many of our filmmakers find that their disability impacted their filmmaking and led to the unique voice or aesthetic their film brings. Does that resonate with you at all? If so, how?\nJustin:\nAbsolutely, I believe that mainstream culture survives and thrives on the fringes and that is what we bring to the table as disabled filmmakers – a unique voice and world view. I think there is an increasing argument for a school of disability filmmaking and I’m currently writing a book on that subject.\nNathan: How do you think your film challenges and/or improves traditional filmmaking/storytelling about disability?\nJustin:\nIt seems to me the traditional depictions of disabled people in narrative film is either as a villain or a victim. With\nReasonable Adjustment\nI wanted to depict disabled people acting in a way which was questionable and challenged the traditional moral values of the audiences. The film actually began life as part of an exhibition for the Richard Attenborough Gallery in the UK and what was interesting as I eavesdropped on conversations of the gallery visitors was how people thought the group were justified in their actions!\nNathan: What surprised you while making this film?\nJustin:\nI was surprised at how the film was received. It premiered as part of an arts festival at the Southbank Centre which is a major art space in London. It had 60,000 views in one weekend and was actually banned by facebook because some people objected to the language used on grounds of hate speech. We were able to get it put back up though. It was also banned by another festival in the UK because it was seen as controversial. I think people are used to different kinds of depictions of disabled people and it is hard for them to process depictions that are not the norm. It's interesting that the people who objected to it are by and large non-disabled.\nNathan: What about your film are you most proud of?\nJustin:\nI am proud we got banned from Facebook! I’m also proud that it works – that people think its real. There was a lot of sleight of hand involved and I’m glad that the efforts we went to paid off.\nNathan: You handled the audio description of\nReasonable Adjustment\nyourself to make it match the tone of the film. Please share anything you’d want your audience to know about your approach and process.\nJustin:\nFor audio description we invented our own automated version purportedly devised by Texas Instruments called TalkTextTM, the audio description track for the film gives its own narrative, designed to reflect ableist attitudes and language of that time. I think audiences should listen to it, as it tells us a lot about how far terminology has come in the last 30 years.\nNathan: Film festivals like Superfest showcase those stories that Hollywood often leaves behind. What do you want to see happen next for disability in film, on both a large and small scale?\nJustin:\nThe key is getting more disabled filmmakers behind the camera, for example everyone talks about CODA* but why wasn’t the director/writer/producer Deaf? The filmmaking community  needs to stop taking it for granted that disabled stories can be authentically told by non disabled filmmakers and it's our job to constantly challenge that notion.'\n(*Editor's note: This refers to a different CODA than the film screening at Superfest 2021.)\nNathan: What are you currently working on?\nJustin:\nI’m producing four disability shorts for Film Four here in London. It's really exciting they are backing disabled film talent and the films are all on the theme of Love and will premiere on Valentines Day!\nTo check out Justin Edgar's film at Superfest,\nget your passes now\nand check it out any point October 15-17.
