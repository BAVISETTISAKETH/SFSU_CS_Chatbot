Once you enroll in your Culminating Experience course, you are expected to complete your degree within two semesters or maintain continuous enrollment until you earn your degree.¬† You are not required to enroll in coursework the semester immediately following enrollment in your Culminating Experience (CE) course if your Culminating Experience has not been completed.\nYou are allowed a ‚Äúgrace‚Äù semester in which to complete your Culminating Experience and earn your degree. For example, if you enroll in your Culminating Experience course in Spring 2022, you are permitted to continue your work through the Fall 2022 semester without enrolling. However, if you do not complete your Culminating Experience by the end of the Fall 2022 grace semester, you must enroll Spring 2023, and each semester thereafter until you earn your degree. You may enroll in the 499 course offered through CPaGE or in a course offered through the regular university enrollment process on advisement of your faculty.\nDoctoral students are not eligible to enroll in the 499 course. Doctoral students must adhere to program specific continuous enrollment requirements, and should consult with their Academic Department Chair for guidance.\nStudents who do not complete their CE during the semester of enrollment in the CE or the following semester (the \"grace\" semester) must enroll in a zero-unit College of Extended Learning (CEL) CE course every subsequent semester until the CE is completed. Enrollment in the CEL CE course provides students access to SFSU libraries, discipline-associated laboratories and facilities, and CE advisors. Students will be assumed to have withdrawn from their degree program if they fail to maintain continuous enrollment status after the grace semester. (For the purpose of this policy, only the fall and spring semesters are counted as semesters.)\nStudents who do not maintain continuous enrollment in their CE course and subsequently return to complete their CE within the 7-year time limit to complete requirements for graduate degrees must be reinstated in their degree program. To be reinstated, students must retroactively enroll in the CEL CE course for all semesters after the initial CE enrollment except the grace semester and file a new Proposal for Culminating Experience. Students who are past the 7-year limit must formally reapply for admission to the program in which they were completing their CE. No guarantee of admission can be assumed. If readmitted, students shall follow the degree requirements in effect at the time of readmission and must submit a new Graduate Approved Program to the Division of Graduate Studies. For more detailed information please refer to Academic Senate Policy S08-246 or to the\nSF State\nBulletin\nUse this link,\nhttps://cel.sfsu.edu/continuous\n, to find the available Continuous Enrollment courses for this term.\nCheck to see if you have the necessary CPaGE 499 Course Requirement indicator in your ‚ÄúStudent Center.‚Äù This indicator will appear under ‚ÄúHolds & Alerts‚Äù on the right side of your ‚ÄúStudent Center‚Äù. If you\ndo not\nhave this indicator, stop and contact Graduate Studies at (415) 338-2234. If the indicator appears on your record, proceed to Step 3.\nEnroll using the class number you noted by contacting Enrollment Services at (415) 405-7700 (Enrollment Services will assist you with payment options).\nDoctoral students are not eligible to enroll in the 499 course.

    "content": "Genesis Maria Sorrick - 2024 Graduate Hood Recipient\nGenesis Sorrick - Master of Arts, Philosophy\nGenesis Sorrick gave birth to her first child amidst the chaos of COVID-19, the eerie orange sky from raging wildfires, and protests against police brutality. Inspired to understand the world better and envision a brighter future for her daughter, she decided to return to college and complete her B.A. in Philosophy at SF State.\nLater, during Sorrick‚Äôs first semester as a Philosophy graduate student at SF State, she began to experience excruciating pain and debilitating neurological symptoms. She channeled her energy into understanding her experience and found solace in her studies. She wrote brilliant research papers, contributed insightfully to discussions, and worked conscientiously as a teaching assistant while maintaining a 4.0 grade-point average. Living with chronic pain led Sorrick to her thesis: a remarkably original, meticulously researched and highly persuasive account of medical gaslighting.\nSorrick‚Äôs journey has been shaped by additional obstacles. She is Mexican-born and the first in her family to complete a college degree. Also, as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, she came out in a primarily conservative town. Rather than dissuade her from pursuing her dreams, these experiences helped Sorrick develop the strength and tenacity she needed to thrive at SF State, raise her children and live with chronic pain. She is a remarkable person, strongly committed to enacting\npositive change as a philosopher and mother",

    "content": "Interdisciplinary Studies\nAn MA/MS in interdisciplinary studies is an innovative and individualized program for students whose interests and academic goals are not satisfactorily attained through one of the master's degrees programs offered at San Francisco State. These individualized degrees provide an opportunity for students and faculty to design courses of study that are highly responsive to emerging fields of knowledge and practice.\nA MA/MS in Interdisciplinary Studies needs to be initiated by the student in collaboration with faculty. Students will need to develop a 30‚Äì36 unit plan of study that draws on courses from at least three disciplines from two Colleges with the intent to integrate the concepts and perspectives of those disciplines into a focused central theme leading to new ways of looking at a subject, issues or problem relevant to a student's unique interests.\nThe courses to be applied toward the degree must be carefully selected for their interrelatedness and general applicability to the objectives of the unique program of study being proposed. Determination of degree designation as an MS or MA is the decision of the major advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. This degree cannot be used to meet credential or licensing requirements.\nThe program must:\nBe compatible with the general mission and objectives of the University.\nBe based upon regular courses already offered in the University.\nInclude 30- 36 unit plan of study that draws on courses from at least three disciplines from two Colleges.\nBe supported by members of the faculty with expertise in the areas of study.\nFor more information or if you have any questions about Interdisciplinary Studies, please contact the Associate Director of Enrollment & Curricular Engagement: Khaled Ezzat at\nkhaled@sfsu.edu\nApplication Instructions\nIdentify your primary faculty advisor and two additional tenured or tenure-line faculty members at SF State campus who have the expertise and interest in advising and supporting you in the proposed program of study.\nEmail Khaled Ezzat,\nthe Interdisciplinary Studies Program Coordinator\nat\nkhaled@sfsu.edu\nto obtain the Proposed Interdisciplinary Studies Program Requirements Form which is required for upload to the documents section of this application.\nComplete the Documents, Recommendations, and Questions sections of\nCal State Apply\n.\nAdmission Criteria\nAll applicants for an Interdisciplinary Studies master‚Äôs program must:\nMeet the general requirements for admission to graduate study as specified in the University Bulletin.\nHave earned a 3.25 grade point average in the undergraduate degree or in the last 60 academic semester units taken prior to admission to Graduate Studies.\nHave demonstrated English competency and proficiency before beginning the program, which can be met by earning a score of 4.5 or better on the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) analytical writing section (students with a business background can substitute the GMAT analytical writing score of 4.5). Students can also demonstrate English proficiency by completing a Writing intensive course. This course can be used to meet this requirement upon approval from the Primary Major Advisor and the Division of Graduate Studies.\nStudents may not use courses from fields of study, such as, nursing, physical therapy or counseling which lead to licensure or certification unless a single course is specifically authorized by the department chair.\nHave identified and met with the primary faculty advisor and two additional tenured or tenure-line faculty members at SF State campus who have the expertise and interest in advising and supporting you in the proposed program of study. The primary faculty advisor must be from a department that offers a graduate degree. Lecturer faculty may not serve on Interdisciplinary Studies committees because lecturer faculty may not be available each semester for advising.",
