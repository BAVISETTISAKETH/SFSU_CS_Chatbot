The collection, originally based upon the Peter Parley to Penrod Bibliography, is considered to be a major scholarly resource showing the progressive development and growth of American children's literature from the 1820s to the 1920s, and includes many original editions of literary classics, as well as early textbooks and related teaching aids.\nTo find items from the Archer Collection in\nOneSearch\n, use\nRefine my Results\nto select\nSpecial Collections\nin the\nLibrary\nfacet.\nYou are welcome to submit questions or requests\nvia email\n.

As an educator, librarian, and innovator, she taught reading and convinced the editor of School Library Journal to devote an issue to \"individualized reading.” She explored ways to meet children's differing styles of learning and developed an early elementary media center in Westchester County, New York. Later she was a Professor of English and Library Science at Shippensburg State College in Pennsylvania. Archer founded the Assembly on Literature for Adolescents of the first National Council of Teachers of English.",

She studied at San Francisco State University, receiving a Master’s degree in film in 1975.\nHer first film to include homosexual themes was\nA Gay Day\n, a 1973 satire about gay marriage, followed shortly by\nDyketactics\nin 1974, which was one of the first lesbian films by an openly lesbian filmmaker in the U.S.\nHammer’s filmography spans more than 40 years and includes nearly 80 films and a handful of accolades. Hammer told the News that her films have consistently been of the experimental and avant-garde genres, alike in their exploration of themes of lesbian identity and sexuality. However, her work has not been solely limited to these themes: Her latest film,\nWelcome to this House: A Film on Elizabeth Bishop”\n(2015), is a documentary about the various homes and personal life of the eponymous American poet.\nRead the full story\nFeed",

    "content": "Antiracism at the Library\nStatement\nMembers of the J. Paul Leonard Library staff, faculty, and administration are committed to combating racism and bringing an antiracist lens to our everyday work by actively identifying and countering racist ideas, rhetoric, policy, and systems in our library. We know that libraries have historically played a role in maintaining longstanding systems of oppression based on race. Recognizing that many at SF State have personally experienced racism and marginalization, we are also dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our community feels welcomed, valued, respected, and seen. We advocate and support similar work being done on our campus, in our communities, and throughout the library profession.\nWords matter, but a statement like this means little without action. That’s why we are also creating annual antiracism action plans, setting concrete goals, and committing to assess our progress regularly.\nPublished August 2024\nCommitments\nConfront bias and white supremacy in library practices and policies.\nUpdate our recruitment and retention practices to enact more inclusive practices for BIPOC library workers and members of other marginalized groups.\nIncorporate a critical awareness of the intersectionality of all identities and lived experiences into our antiracist practices.\nSet specific and measurable goals at all levels of the organization and hold ourselves accountable through periodic assessment.\nRegularly seek community feedback to shape our antiracist action plans and evaluate the outcomes.\nConnect with other groups and individuals working toward transformative change on campus.\nGoals & Action Plans\n2024 – 25 Academic Year\nThis year's antiracism action plan will be developed as part of library-wide strategic planning.\n2021 – 22 Academic Year\nOne Library, Many Stories: Antiracism —\nThis group, formed in 2020 – 21, continued to facilitate One Library One Book discussion sessions focused on shared reading or viewing of antiracist books and films.\nContent Warnings Group —\nThis group, also formed in 2020 – 21, finalized a\nStatement on Harmful Content and Description\nand developed a\nform\nfor reporting concerns with library materials that may contain language or imagery that is racist, sexist, homophobic, violent, etc. The group developed a process for reviewing this feedback and adding subsequent content warnings.\nReparative Descriptive Work Group —\nThis group was created in Special Collections & Archives in 2021 to address collections and finding aids containing harmful content. It developed an anti-oppressive assessment rubric and language to insert in finding aids to alert users to finding aids and collections containing potential harmful language and items.\nUnit-Level Planning —\nThe associate university librarian and interim head of Collection Management Services and Scholarly Communication worked with individual units in Spring 2022 to develop specific goals in support of our library-wide commitment to antiracism.\n2020 – 21 Academic Year\nOur Associate University Librarian’s Council initiated the creation of three working groups in the spring of 2021 to focus on the following priorities. All library faculty and staff were invited to join in these projects:\nAntiracism Statement Group —\nThis group conducted a review of antiracism statements, drafted an antiracism statement for the library’s website, and solicited feedback.\nAntiracism Discussion Group —\nThis group facilitated One Library One Book discussion sessions focused on shared reading or viewing of antiracist books and films, beginning with our inaugural reading of Ibram X. Kendi’s\nHow to be an Antiracist\n.\nContent Warnings Group —\nThis group worked on developing content warnings for our collections to warn users before they click on library materials that may contain language or imagery that is racist, sexist, homophobic, violent, etc. While the library does not endorse such ideas, we do have materials that express them that we make accessible for historical or research purposes.\nReparative Descriptive Work Group\n— This group set a timeline and goals for the number of legacy finding aids to be assessed.\n2019 – 20 Academic Year\nAntiracism Statement —\nA group of library faculty and staff collaborated on a\nJ. Paul Leonard Library Workers Statement on Anti-Racism\nin June of 2020. The statement was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, and in it, library workers committed to a range of antiracist actions intended to address the systemic racism that Black members of our communities face. Many of those actions will take time and broad consultation with our campus community as well as other stakeholders to achieve, and some things may not be feasible at this time or might have to look different. However, the library’s faculty and staff will continue to refer back to this statement for ideas and inspiration.\nAntiracism Resources Guide —\nLibrary faculty and staff also collaborated on our\nAntiracism Resources Guide\nin the summer of 2020.\nBlack Lives Matter Wikipedia Edit-a-thons —\nThe library’s Digital Scholarship Center began hosting\nBlack Lives Matter Wikipedia edit-a-thons\nin July of 2020. These edit-a-thons were held on a monthly basis and were open to our entire campus community.",
