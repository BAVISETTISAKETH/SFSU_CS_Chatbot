Your resume, cover letter, and network connections helped you stand out in a pool of applicants, but now is your chance to wow the employer by showing your fit with the company and excitement for the opportunity. Being well-prepared for the interview will give you the confidence to impress the employer and succeed in obtaining a job offer.\nReview our\ninterviewing handouts\nregarding the types of interviews, common interview questions, dressing for interviews, follow-up thank you notes, and general advice to help you prepare.\nPlease choose a category below to view:\nPractice Interviewing\nBuild your interview confidence with our online Hiration tool. Practice common interview questions, questions related to your job description, and review sample answers‚Äîall in one place. You can answer questions in writing or by recording a video, which is the most effective method. Give it a try!\nHiration Interviewing Tool\nJob Offers\nCongratulations on the job offer! Be sure to receive a formal, written confirmation of the offer that includes information about position title, start date, salary, benefits, and deadline for responding.\nIf in doubt, a career counselor with CLD can help you through the process of evaluating the offer, negotiating salary, and deciding whether to accept or decline the offer\nSome areas to consider when evaluating an offer are:\nJob Duties:\nWhat are the job duties and responsibilities? Are they realistic and exciting? Will the work be challenging to you? Are there a variety of tasks to perform? Are there opportunities for growth?\nWork Environment:\nDo you like the physical work environment? Do you feel comfortable with your future supervisor and fellow employees? Is your supervisor likely to be a good mentor? Do your values and lifestyle correspond with the values and culture of the organization?\nOrganization:\nWhat is the organization's reputation? Is the organization growing or downsizing?\nCompensation:\nWhat is the total compensation package (base salary and benefits)? Does the salary meet your financial needs and obligations? If the salary is low, are there opportunities for significant responsibilities and advancement? What benefits are offered, i.e. healthcare, vacation, sick time, etc.?¬† Be aware that some smaller employers offer creative benefits to attract good employees including stock options, transportation costs, free meals, flextime, telecommuting, etc.\nSalary Negotiations\nDon't be afraid to negotiate your offer! The employer expects it. Check out websites such as\nGlassdoor\n,\nSalary\n, or\nLinkedIn Salary\nto explore salary ranges by job title and location. See how years of experience, industry, location and more can impact your salary and use this to support any salary negotiations you make.\nSalary Negotiation Handout",

We do not endorse the employers who list job openings or guarantee the accuracy of the information therein. Those who use the job listings do so at their own risk. Career & Leadership Development, its staff, the California State University System and the State of California assume no liabilities related to the accuracy or inaccuracy of information provided in job listings and do not represent or act on behalf of the hiring authority.\nStudents should be aware of potential job posting scams. Any off-campus position is outside of SF State jurisdiction and as such the University assumes no liability or obligation in verifying validity of postings. Please use extreme caution in applying for off-campus positions. Students should NEVER pay for employment opportunities. If any employer asks for money, wishes to engage in wire transfers, or discusses advance payment for work that has not been performed, please discontinue all correspondence with that employer and contact your local police department. Some local police departments have websites to report fraud.\nCareer & Leadership Development does its best to screen job postings. However, we make no recommendations or guarantees about the positions and employers listed through our office. Due to the volume of jobs received, we are unable to research the integrity of every position listed. Therefore, students are urged to take on this responsibility themselves. We encourage you to use common sense and caution when applying for positions, especially when applying for positions off campus. If a potential employer asks you to participate in an activity that makes you uncomfortable in any way, don't do it. You may also wish to check with other services that rate businesses, for example, the local Better Business Bureau.\nHow to Avoid Scams:\nResearch the Employer\nCheck their website and call the number listed on the job posting. Scammers will often use a legitimate business as a cover, so don't be afraid to contact the business and inquire about the posting.\nMeet Face-to-Face with Potential Employers\nBe sure to choose a public place for your meeting, tell someone where you are going and bring your cell phone with you just in case.\nNever Wire Funds to an Employer\nTo protect yourself from scammers:\nDon't accept cashier/certified checks or money orders: bank will cash these fakes and then hold you responsible.\nNever give out financial information (bank account, social security, PayPal account, etc).\nRefuse background/credit checks until you have met employer in person.\nNever apply for a job with someone who indicates they are away on business or are out of the country and needs you to begin right away. Resist pressure to do something right away.\nBe skeptical. If a job offers a lot of money for very little work, it is likely a scam. If a job seems too good to be true, it probably is.\nPersonal Safety :\nWhen meeting someone for the first time, please remember to :\nInsist on a public meeting place like a cafe, bank, or shopping center.\nDo not meet in a secluded place, or invite strangers into your home.\nTell a friend or family member where you're going.\nTake your cell phone along if you have one.\nConsider having a friend accompany you.\nTrust your instincts.\nWhat To Do If You Find a Fraudulent Job Posting or Believe You've Been Scammed :\nIf you have encountered a fraudulent posting, company or organization on Handshake, please email\ncareer@sfsu.edu\n, so the posting can be investigated and appropriate action can be taken.\nConsult with Career & Leadership Development (CLD) immediately if you have been scammed to determine whether you should contact the\nUniversity Police Department\nor the local police. The police are responsible for conducting an investigation regardless of whether the scam artist is local or in another state.\nIf you have sent money to a fraudulent employer, you should contact your bank and/or credit card company immediately to close the account and dispute the charges.\nIf the incident occurred completely over the internet, you should file an incident report with\nThe United States Department of Justice\nand\nThe Federal Trade Commission\n.\nTo learn more about employment scams, your rights, and appropriate actions, please visit this helpful page from the\nRiley Guide\nAll job listings are posted at the discretion of CLD. We will not approve jobs that appear to discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, age, national origin, veteran status, sexual orientation, disability, or gender. CLD also reserves the right to refuse to post jobs that do not support the interests of the University.\nClick here to go to the Top!",

In the United States, a CV is used when applying for graduate school, PhD programs, and academic positions. It showcases your professional history, teaching experience, presentation and conference participation, educational history, dissertations, skills, honors and awards, etc. Unlike a resume, there is no limit to the number of pages. Of note, outside of the U.S. people refer to their resume as a CV.\nCV Template\nCurriculum Vitae Guide\nCover Letter\nWhat is a Cover Letter and How Do I Write a Good One?\nPurpose\nThe purpose of a cover letter is to introduce yourself and demonstrate interest in the position for which you are applying. Your letter is an opportunity¬†to sell yourself, expand on your abilities and provide examples of why you are the best candidate for the position.¬†¬†¬†‚Äã\n‚Äã\nThink of the resume and cover letter as documents that are working together in conjunction. The cover letter is an elaboration on the experiences¬†that show up in your resume.¬†A well-written cover letter can put¬†you¬†miles ahead of the competition.\nWhen creating a cover letter, keep it to one page.¬† The body of the letter should consist of three main paragraphs as shown below (also see the attached Cover Letter handout for an example).\nSimple Steps to Prepare\n1.\nRead through the job description thoroughly and highlight important keywords and phrases.\n2.\nSpend time researching the company. Go to their website and social media channels to understand their mission, values, key projects,¬†products and people.\n3.\nBased on your research, reflect on \"why\" you want to work at this particular organization.\nThe Formula - I Love You¬† |¬† You Love Me¬† |¬† Let's Connect\nI Love You - Opening Paragraph\nState the position you are applying for and where you found it.\nWrite 2-3 sentences -\nWhy you LOVE them -\nLet them know you've done your homework on the company and the job.

SFSU is our leading university partner in California. We have recruited over 600 bright and talented SFSU graduates into our program, which has been made possible through our valuable relationships with university faculty members.\"\n‚Äì Erica Torres\nSenior Recruiting Manager,\nCOOP Careers\n\"The career fair that was held this past Spring was a big time draw for SFUSD. We were able to engage with a great set of candidates ready and willing to discuss their future with our school district! The staff did a great job at making sure all who were tabling at the event were taken care of and sent lots of candidates to possibly interview.\"\n‚Äì Seilala Zumbado\nSenior Recruiter,\nSan Francisco Unified School District\n\"The SFSU Campus Career & Leadership Development Team were AWESOME! Our organization participated in their Career Job Fair held on 04/13/23. The event organizers were communicative throughout the days leading up to the event. Additionally, Dan Curtin and [the] team also provided follow-up communication in the form of post-event support. The team did not forget us just because the job fair had come to a close. Additionally, we were also able to take advantage of the Handshake job posting platform. It enabled our team to throw a wider net for trying to attract talent. We were grateful for the exposure and are looking forward to engaging with SFSU Career Leadership Team in the near future.\"\n‚Äì Cleopatra Trufant\nCommunity Liaison,\nCDF Third Baptist Freedom School SF\n\"Recruiting at SFSU was a productive and exciting experience. We connected with talented and motivated students who displayed excellent skills and enthusiasm. The job fairs allowed us to engage with potential candidates, showcase our company culture, and build valuable relationships for future opportunities. Our team loved the large space available, and on-camera interview. We also really appreciated the effort in feeding our hungry team, and providing parking vouchers. Most of all we really appreciated the accommodations made by the organizers, when we requested expanded space. This helped us bring a strong hiring team, able to work with multiple students at one time. Out of all the colleges we visited this semester SFSU made the experience worthwhile and comfortable.\"\n‚Äì Philip Broadus\nOperations Director,\nJCYC\n\"SFSU‚Äôs Office of Career and Leadership Development has a strong partnership with our Campus Outreach team. I had the pleasure of hosting many on-campus and virtual workshops at SFSU, and I had many meaningful conversations with students. Students have told us that they find the one-on-one sessions to be particularly valuable, as they provide them with the opportunity to get personalized advice and support. These sessions have helped to boost students' confidence and motivation to pursue a career in tech.\"\n‚Äì Mike Leung\nSoftware Engineer,\nGoogle\n\"Enterprise Holdings loves recruiting at SFSU. The Office of Career and Leadership Development has been a huge resource when it comes to our campus recruiting plan. We have had opportunities to participate in traditional career fairs, workshops, presentations and connections with clubs and organizations on campus.

    "content": "Tuesday, November 19, 2019\nGraduate student Jason Appler discovered his passion for product design in an unlikely place: an administrative office in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He has experienced the thrills of traveling through dangerous waters as a commercial fisherman in Alaska and as a NOAA Corps officer. But design theory is what motivates him now.\nIterative problem-solving processes based in design theory have become all the rage at leading companies and universities worldwide. Appler first utilized them when working as a strategic planning lead in NOAA‚Äôs Office of Performance, Risk and Social Science. The office doesn‚Äôt make products, but uses design theory to help the agency‚Äôs leadership plan effective policy. Appler says it helps disparate groups of people think creatively as a group and step outside of their box.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same process when you develop an app or widget,‚Äù says Appler, who holds a bachelor‚Äôs degree in biology from Villanova University and an MBA from the Naval Postgraduate School. ‚ÄúYou feel the pain of the person who has the problem. You keep reiterating until you find a strong solution.‚Äù\nYou feel the pain of the person who has the problem. You keep reiterating until you find a strong solution.‚Äù ‚Äî Jason Appler\nAppler recently won the Jerry Streichler Scholar Award from the western U.S. region of Epsilon Pi Tau, an international honor society for design and technology. He received the award at the society‚Äôs 90th anniversary board and trustee members conference in September in Orlando, Florida.\n‚ÄúJason demonstrates great capacity for leadership. He has a certain humbleness about himself,‚Äù said Design Professor Ricardo Gomes, who serves as trustee for SF State‚Äôs Beta Beta chapter of Epsilon Pi Tau. ‚ÄúHe exemplifies a mantra that I use often: Design with us, not for us. He represents that collective, inclusionary approach to design, getting the best attributes of his team and adopting them in a collaborative, cohesive manner. ‚Äù\nAt SF State, Appler has used his leadership skills and design-theory experience to tackle numerous problems. Last year he founded the Design Guild, a student-run organization for professional development. He also led a team of students creating an online platform that connects youth volunteers with senior citizens. The project was a finalist in the Stanford Center on Longevity Design Challenge. For his thesis, Appler has designed an efficient kitchen system for adults living in shared home environments.\n‚ÄúThe beauty of the Design M.A. program at San Francisco State is that it provides a strong foundation in the theory and process,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy going here, I have a stronger foundation to give me flexibility in my future pursuits.‚Äù\n‚Äî Matt Itelson\nLinks\nEpsilon Pi Tau\nJason Appler\nSchool of Design\nNews Article",

The course will be listed on your transcript showing that you have practical, as well as classroom, experience. The requirement for credit varies from department to¬†department, and¬†is generally determined by your department faculty advisor. Your faculty advisor will determine the amount of credit according to your level of responsibility and the number of hours per week on the job. A faculty advisor will assess your learning and performance and may require that you write a report or provide a critical analysis of a project. The internship must provide you with specific problems to solve and be related to your field of study.\nIs There a Charge for Working as an Intern?\nOnly internships which are taken for academic credit require tuition payment‚Äîjust like any other course. The tuition and charges pay for supervisors, monitoring, evaluation of your work performance and transcript notation. There is no charge for internships¬†not¬†taken for academic credit. In fact, a wage may be required according to the U.S. Dept. of Labor's Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Please review the Wage and Hour Division\n‚Äô\ns\nseven-point unpaid intern test\nif you would like to know more about unpaid internship regulations.¬†The employer should never charge you.\nCan I Develop an Internship on My Own?\nCareer and Leadership Development puts on several career fairs each year both in the fall and spring semesters. We also provide on-campus interview (OCI) opportunities for employers to interview our students on our campus for the convenience of both employers and students. You can arrange your own placement related to your field of study. If you wish to earn academic credit, the internship must be approved before you register for classes. See your department's faculty advisor for more information. If you do not wish to obtain academic credit, have clear goals established with the employer about your work experience and agree to have work experiences that are related to your major.\nWhat is a Cooperative Education Program (Co-op)?\nA Cooperative Education Program is another type of program offered by employers that provides paid career-related work experience and offers academic credit. For more information, visit the\nSF State Cooperative Education Program\n.\nQuestions to Consider Before an Internship:\nWill I have opportunities to gain practical experience in my chosen field or learn if this area of my major is the right fit for me?\nWill I have an engaged supervisor working with me to create a successful experience based on my internship goals?\nIs there a strong education, research, or project-oriented aspect to the internship?\nIs my position as an intern somewhat independent of established, paid positions within this organization? If the internship is unpaid and you answered no to either of these questions, carefully review the Wage and Hour Division‚Äôs seven-point unpaid\nintern test\nClick Here to Go to the Top!",
