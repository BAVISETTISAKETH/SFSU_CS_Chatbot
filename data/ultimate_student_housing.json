    "content": "Thursday, July 21, 2016\nSAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER -- San Francisco State University, a commuter school with a student body spread throughout the Bay Area, could triple student housing at certain sites along its southern border under a proposal up for public review this month. The proposal calls for the university to demolish two current on-campus housing sites and replace them over a two-year stretch with a mixed-use development, a new Creative Arts Building and an 800-seat concert hall. The proposal is part of a transformation the university campus has experienced in recent years, including a $2 million renovation of the campus gymnasium in 2014 and the construction of an $86.5 million wellness and recreation center that is slated for completion in 2017. Construction of the new Creative Arts Building and concert hall at Tapia Triangle is expected to begin in Fall 2017 and last two years. The mixed-use building would begin construction shortly thereafter and be completed in 2019.\nRead the full story\nFeed",
