**Why**:
1. ‚úÖ Get live in 30 minutes
2. ‚úÖ Completely FREE
3. ‚úÖ Easy to manage
4. ‚úÖ 14,400 requests/day is usually enough for university chatbot
5. ‚úÖ Can **always switch to Ollama later** if you need more capacity

### When to Use Ollama from Start:
- You **know** you'll have high traffic
- You need 100% uptime with no rate limits
- Data privacy is critical
- You're experienced with server management

---

## üîÑ Can I Switch Later?

**YES!** Super easy to switch between them:

### From Groq ‚Üí Ollama:
1. Set up VPS with Ollama
2. Change 1 line in code (`backend/main.py:17`)
3. Redeploy

### From Ollama ‚Üí Groq:
1. Get Groq API key
2. Change 1 line in code (`backend/main.py:17`)
3. Redeploy

**Both use the same codebase!** Just one import statement change.

## üÜò Need More Help Deciding?

### Questions to Consider:

A: Not really. Llama 3.3 70B (Groq) is also excellent and often better.

**Q: What if I exceed Groq's free tier?**
A: Groq will give you error messages. You can then switch to Ollama or upgrade Groq plan.

**Q: Is Ollama deployment hard?**
A: Not if you follow the guide! Basic Linux knowledge helpful but guide is detailed.

**Q: Can I test both?**
A: YES! Test Groq first (easy), then set up Ollama if needed.

**Q: Which is faster?**
A: Groq is actually faster (optimized infrastructure). Ollama is fast too on good hardware.

**Q: Which is more reliable?**
A: Both are reliable. Groq has better uptime. Ollama depends on your server.
