- **Backend (main.py & database.py):**
  - Created `FeedbackRequest` Pydantic model
  - Added `/feedback` POST endpoint
  - Implemented `log_feedback()` method in DatabaseService
  - Stores feedback with query, response, feedback_type, session_id, and message_id

- **Database:**
  - New `feedback` table with columns:
    - id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
    - session_id (TEXT)
    - message_id (TEXT)
    - query (TEXT NOT NULL)
    - response (TEXT NOT NULL)
    - feedback_type (TEXT CHECK: 'thumbs_up' or 'thumbs_down')
    - created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)

## Database Schema Changes

### New Table: `feedback`
```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (

    query TEXT NOT NULL,
    response TEXT NOT NULL,
    feedback_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (feedback_type IN ('thumbs_up', 'thumbs_down')),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_created_at ON feedback(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_type ON feedback(feedback_type);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_session ON feedback(session_id);
```

**Note:** Run the SQL from `create_feedback_table.py` in Supabase SQL Editor to create the table.

## Performance Considerations
