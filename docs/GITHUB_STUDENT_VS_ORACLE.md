## üí∏ Break-Even Analysis

**Time until Oracle Cloud saves you money**:

If you use DigitalOcean after credit runs out:

- $96/month plan = Oracle saves you money after Month 1

**Conclusion**: Oracle Cloud ALWAYS saves money long-term, but costs more time upfront.

**Time vs Money Trade-off**:
- DigitalOcean: Pay with TIME upfront (easier = less time), pay with MONEY later
- Oracle Cloud: Pay with TIME upfront (harder = more time), FREE forever
