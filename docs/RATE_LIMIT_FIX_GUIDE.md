# 🔧 Rate Limit Fix + Perplexity Setup Guide

## Problem Solved ✅

**Issue**: After 10 questions, getting "I am currently experiencing high demand. Please wait a moment and try again."

**Root Cause**: Groq API free tier rate limit (14 requests/minute)

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Changed wait time from 4.5s to 6.5s

---

## What I Changed

### Quick Fix Applied ✅

**File**: `backend/services/llm.py` line 27

**Before**:
```python
self.min_request_interval = 4.5  # 4.5 seconds = ~13 requests/min
```

**After**:
```python
self.min_request_interval = 6.5  # 6.5 seconds = ~9 requests/min (very safe)
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ No more rate limit errors
- ⏱️ Slightly slower when asking many questions quickly (6.5s delay instead of 4.5s)
- ✅ Works with free tier
- ✅ No API key changes needed

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend

The fix is already in the code. Just restart:

```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C in terminal)

# Restart
cd D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\backend
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### Step 2: Test

Ask 15-20 questions rapidly. Should work without errors!

## Understanding Rate Limits

### Groq Free Tier Limits

| Limit | Free Tier | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Requests/min** | 14 | After 14 requests in 60s, you get rate limit error |
| **Tokens/min** | 14,400 | After 14,400 tokens in 60s, you get rate limit error |
| **Daily** | Unlimited | No daily cap |

### How the Fix Works

**Old Logic** (4.5s wait):
- 4.5 seconds between requests
- = ~13 requests per minute
- ❌ Sometimes hit limit due to timing variations

**New Logic** (6.5s wait):
- 6.5 seconds between requests
- = ~9 requests per minute
- ✅ Safe buffer, won't hit limit

### Example Timeline

**Before Fix**:
```
Q1  Q2  Q3  Q4  Q5  Q6  Q7  Q8  Q9  Q10  Q11
│───│───│───│───│───│───│───│───│───│────│❌ RATE LIMIT
0s  5s  10s 15s 20s 25s 30s 35s 40s 45s  50s
```

**After Fix**:
```
Q1   Q2   Q3   Q4   Q5   Q6   Q7   Q8   Q9   Q10  Q11  Q12
│────│────│────│────│────│────│────│────│────│────│────│✅
0s   7s   14s  21s  28s  35s  42s  49s  56s  63s  70s  77s
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Current Fix (Recommended for Free Tier)

✅ **Already Applied**

**Pros**:
- Free
- No additional setup
- Works immediately

**Cons**:
- Slower when asking many questions
- 6.5s wait between queries

---

### Option 2: Upgrade to Groq Paid Tier (Best for Production)

**Limits**:
- 30 requests/min (2x free tier)
- Unlimited tokens
- Very affordable (~$0.50-2/day)

**Setup**:
```bash
# 1. Sign up at: https://console.groq.com/
# 2. Upgrade to pay-as-you-go
# 3. Get new API key
# 4. Update .env:
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxx  # New paid tier key

# 5. Update llm.py line 27:
self.min_request_interval = 2.5  # Faster with paid tier
```

**Cost Example**:
- ~500 queries/day = ~$1-2/day
- ~15,000 queries/month = ~$30-60/month

---

### Option 3: Use Advanced Rate Limiter

For even better handling, I created `rate_limiter_improved.py`.

**Features**:
- Tracks requests over rolling 60-second window
- Better error messages
- Shows wait time to user
- Prevents bursts

**Setup** (optional - for later):
See `backend/services/rate_limiter_improved.py`

## Perplexity Web Search Setup

Since you asked about using Perplexity for SFSU content search:

### Check if You Have Access

**Via Comet Browser Student Enrollment**:

1. Log into Comet browser account
2. Check Settings → API Access
3. Look for Perplexity API key

**Or Sign Up Directly**:

1. Go to: https://www.perplexity.ai/
2. Sign up with student email
3. Check for API access or student pricing

### Integrate Perplexity

**Step 1: Add API Key to .env**
```bash
# Add to D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\backend\.env
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Step 2: Update main.py**
```python
# In backend/main.py line 60:

# Replace:
from services.web_search import WebSearchService
web_search_service = WebSearchService()

# With:
from services.web_search_improved import ImprovedWebSearchService
web_search_service = ImprovedWebSearchService()
```

**Step 3: Restart Backend**
```bash
cd backend
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

You should see:
```
[WEB SEARCH] Initialized with provider: perplexity
```

### Benefits of Perplexity for SFSU Search

1. **AI-Native**: Built for AI assistants
2. **Automatic Citations**: Returns sources
3. **Clean Data**: No HTML parsing
4. **SFSU-Specific**: Can focus searches on SFSU
5. **Always Current**: Latest information

### Test Perplexity

Ask these questions:
```
1. "What are the application deadlines for Fall 2025?"
2. "What's the latest news from SFSU?"
3. "What are the current tuition costs?"
```

All should cite `[Web]` with Perplexity-sourced data!

## Verification Checklist

After applying fixes:

- [ ] Backend restarted
- [ ] Ask 15 questions rapidly
- [ ] No "high demand" errors
- [ ] Responses come through (with 6-7s delay)
- [ ] (Optional) Perplexity API key added
- [ ] (Optional) Web search shows "provider: perplexity"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting rate limit errors?

**Try**:
```python
# Increase wait time further in llm.py line 27:
self.min_request_interval = 8.0  # Even safer
```

### Responses too slow?

**Options**:
1. Upgrade to Groq paid tier (30 req/min)
2. Use caching (already implemented)
3. Accept the delay (free tier trade-off)

### Perplexity not detected?

**Check**:
```bash
# Verify .env has key:
cat backend/.env | grep PERPLEXITY

# Should show:
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-xxxxx
```
