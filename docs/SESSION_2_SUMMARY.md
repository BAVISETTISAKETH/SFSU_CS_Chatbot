# üéì GATOR GUIDE - SESSION 2 SUMMARY
**Date:** October 4-5, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Ready for Testing

---

## üìä WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY

### 1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED ULTIMATE SCRAPING**
- **Pages Scraped:** 3,000 pages across ALL SFSU domains
- **Documents Collected:** 2,954 high-quality documents
- **File Size:** 11MB (`data/sfsu_ultimate_crawl.json`)

### 2. ‚úÖ **MIGRATION COMPLETE**
- **Documents Migrated:** 3,150 total
  - Ultimate crawl: 2,954 documents
  - Aggressive crawl: 196 documents
- **Zero Errors:** Perfect migration
- **Total Database:** 28,541 documents (22,268 old + 3,150 new)

### 3. ‚úÖ **TESTED ALLI EXTENSIVELY**
- **CPT Question:** ‚úÖ Excellent, accurate with sources
- **CS Courses:** ‚úÖ Good, admits when incomplete
- **Financial Aid:** ‚úÖ Comprehensive and helpful
- **Graduate Admissions:** ‚úÖ Detailed guidance
- **OPT Questions:** ‚úÖ Web search triggers correctly

### 4. ‚úÖ **UPDATED BRANDING TO "GATOR GUIDE"**

- **Solution:** Added filter to ONLY use newly scraped SFSU data
- **Result:** All responses now use fresh sfsu.edu sources only

### 6. ‚úÖ **FIXED WEB SEARCH TRIGGERING**
- **Problem:** Web search wasn't triggering when chatbot lacked info
- **Solution:** Increased confidence threshold from 0.4 to 0.6
- **Result:** Web search now triggers automatically for low-confidence queries

## üîß TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE TODAY

### File: `backend/services/rag.py`
**Changes:**
1. **Increased document fetch from 4 to 12** (fetch 3x more to account for filtering)
2. **Added filter to skip old data:**
   ```python
   if 'sfsu_cs_query_system' in source:

**Purpose:** Ensure chatbot ONLY uses newly scraped SFSU data, not old database contents

### File: `backend/main.py`
**Changes:**
1. **Increased web search threshold from 0.4 to 0.6:**
   ```python
   use_web_search = rag_result['confidence'] < 0.6 or await _should_use_web_search(request.query)
   ```

**Purpose:** Trigger web search more frequently when database doesn't have good answers

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS

### What's Running:
- ‚úÖ **Frontend:** http://localhost:5174 (port 5174 due to 5173 being in use)
- ‚úÖ **Backend:** http://localhost:8000

### Database Status:
- ‚úÖ **Total Documents:** 28,541
  - Old data: 22,268 (still in DB but filtered out)
  - New data: 3,150 (actively used)
- ‚úÖ **All new data migrated successfully**

### Features Working:
- ‚úÖ Chat with Alli (Gator Guide)
- ‚úÖ RAG search (using ONLY new SFSU data)
- ‚úÖ Web search fallback (triggers automatically)
- ‚úÖ Source filtering (excludes old irrelevant data)
- ‚úÖ SFSU Purple & Gold branding

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES (To Fix Later)

### 1. **Groq API Rate Limiting**
**Issue:** Hit 30 requests/minute limit during testing
**Impact:** Temporary errors when making rapid requests
**Workaround:** Space out requests by 2-3 seconds
**Future Fix:**
- Implement request queuing
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Consider upgrading to Groq Pro
- Add response caching for common questions

### 2. **Old Data Still in Database**
**Issue:** 22,268 old documents still in Supabase (taking up space)
**Impact:** None (filtered out in code)
**Future Fix:**
- Delete old `sfsu_cs_query_system.*` documents from Supabase
- Keep only the 3,150 new documents
- Will reduce database size and improve performance

### 3. **Some Specific Queries Need Better Data**
**Issue:** Questions like "MS in DS and AI requirements" don't have perfect answers
**Impact:** Chatbot falls back to web search (works, but not ideal)
**Future Fix:**
- Scrape more specific program pages
- Add verified facts for common program questions
- Fine-tune which pages get scraped

### 4. **Node.js Version Warning**
**Issue:** Vite shows warning about Node.js version
**Impact:** None (frontend works fine)
**Future Fix:** Upgrade Node.js to 22.12+ (optional)

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (When You Return)

### Immediate (Next Session):

1. **Clean Up Old Data:**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM documents WHERE source LIKE '%sfsu_cs_query_system%';
   ```
   This will remove the 22,268 old documents and keep only fresh SFSU data.

2. **Add Response Caching:**
   - Cache common questions to reduce API calls
   - Will help with rate limiting

3. **Improve Error Handling:**
   - Better error messages when rate limit hit
   - Show "Please wait a moment" instead of generic error

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Very long questions
   - Multiple questions in one query
   - Questions about non-SFSU topics

### Short-Term (This Week):

1. **Add More Verified Facts:**
   - Common program requirements
   - Important dates (deadlines, etc.)
   - Contact information

2. **Optimize RAG Search:**
   - Fine-tune confidence thresholds
   - Experiment with different embedding models
   - Test retrieval with different k values

3. **UI Improvements:**
   - Show "Alli is typing..." animation
   - Display sources in chat (expandable)
   - Add "Did this answer help?" feedback buttons

### Long-Term (Next Month):

1. **Deploy to Production:**
   - Backend: Railway/Render
   - Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
   - Set up custom domain

2. **Add Analytics:**
   - Track popular questions
   - Monitor response quality
   - Identify gaps in knowledge base

3. **Continuous Scraping:**
   - Set up weekly automatic scraping
   - Keep data fresh and up-to-date

## üìù NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

### Important Reminders:

1. **Rate Limit Management:**
   - Groq API: 30 requests/minute for Llama 3.3 70B
   - If you hit rate limit, wait 60 seconds
   - Consider implementing request queue

2. **Data Filtering Approach:**
   - Current approach: Fetch 12 docs, filter to 4
   - Works well but could be optimized
   - Future: Filter at database level (WHERE clause)

3. **Web Search Threshold:**
   - Current: 0.6 (triggers web search more often)
   - Can adjust based on testing
   - Lower = more web search, Higher = more RAG

4. **Database Cleanup:**
   - Old data (22,268 docs) is filtered in code but still in DB
   - Not causing issues but taking up space
   - Can delete safely with SQL query above

### What's Working Great:

‚úÖ **Data Quality:** New scraped data is excellent
‚úÖ **Source Filtering:** Successfully excludes old irrelevant data
‚úÖ **Web Search:** Triggers appropriately
‚úÖ **Response Quality:** Accurate, helpful, no hallucinations
‚úÖ **Branding:** SFSU Purple & Gold looks great
‚úÖ **Performance:** Fast responses (1-5s)

### What Needs Improvement:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limiting:** Need better handling
‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Messages:** Too generic
‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Size:** Old data should be deleted
‚ö†Ô∏è **Caching:** Would reduce API calls

- Llama 3.3 70B is excellent for quality
- 30 req/min limit hit during testing
- Need rate limiting strategy for production

### 4. **User Testing Reveals Issues**
- Rate limiting discovered during friend testing
- Need better error handling for real users
- Consider implementing retry logic

## üõ†Ô∏è TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Frontend Won't Load:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Check the port number in the output (might be 5174 instead of 5173)
```

### If Backend Errors:
```bash
cd backend
../venv/Scripts/python.exe main.py
# Check for error messages in terminal
```

### If Rate Limit Hit:
- Wait 60 seconds before making more requests
- Space out questions by 2-3 seconds
- Consider upgrading Groq API plan

### If Chatbot Gives Bad Answers:
1. Check if using old data (look at sources)
2. Verify RAG filter is working (`'sfsu_cs_query_system' not in sources`)
3. Check web search threshold (should be 0.6)
4. Restart backend to clear caches
