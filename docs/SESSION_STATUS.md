# SFSU CS Chatbot - Session Status
**Date**: January 10, 2025
**Current Focus**: Professor Registration with Email OTP Verification

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY

### 1. Email OTP Verification System Implementation
- **Goal**: Implement full professor registration flow with email verification
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Backend routes working, system functional

#### What Was Built:
1. **Backend Routes** (all working at `backend/main.py:342-444`):
   - `POST /professor/send-otp` - Send OTP to email
   - `POST /professor/verify-otp` - Verify OTP code
   - `POST /professor/register` - Complete registration after OTP verification
   - `POST /professor/login` - Login endpoint (already existed)

2. **Email Service** (`backend/services/email.py`):
   - Integration with Resend API (free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - OTP generation (6-digit codes)
   - OTP storage with 10-minute expiration
   - Maximum 5 verification attempts per OTP
   - Beautiful HTML email templates with SFSU branding

3. **Frontend** (`frontend/src/pages/ProfessorRegister.jsx`):
   - 3-step registration flow:
     - Step 1: Enter name, email (@sfsu.edu), department
     - Step 2: Enter OTP received via email
     - Step 3: Create password
   - Full error handling and validation
   - Beautiful UI with SFSU colors

4. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Added to `.env`:
     ```
     RESEND_API_KEY=re_Lb1wLbDf_89pD5vNsQn64xMHjMTLmMU9n
     SENDER_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
     ```
   - Updated `requirements.txt` with `resend==0.8.0`

## üêõ ISSUE ENCOUNTERED & FIXED

### Problem: Routes Returning 404
**Symptom**: Registration page showed "Not Found" when trying to send OTP

**Root Cause**: Multiple backend instances running on port 8000 with old cached code

**Solution**:
1. Killed all Python processes
2. Cleared Python `__pycache__`
3. Restarted backend with fresh code
4. Verified routes registered correctly

**Verification Command**:
```bash
cd backend && ../venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "from main import app; print([route.path for route in app.routes])"
```

**Result**: All routes now registered and working! ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT LIMITATION: Resend Free Tier

### Email Delivery Restriction:
**Resend's free tier only sends emails to the account owner's email:**
- Your email: `bavisettisaisaketh@gmail.com`
- **Cannot send to**: `923746340@sfsu.edu` or any other email

### Error Message Received:
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (bavisettisaisaketh@gmail.com).
To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain at resend.com/domains
```

### Workaround Solutions:

#### Option 1: Development Mode OTP Display (IMPLEMENTED)
Modified `backend/services/email.py:140-144` to print OTP in console:
```python
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[ERROR] Failed to send email via Resend: {e}")
    print(f"[DEV MODE] OTP for {to_email}: {otp}")  # ‚Üê Added this line
    self.store_otp(to_email, otp)
    return otp
```

**How to Test**:
1. Register with any @sfsu.edu email
2. Click "Send OTP"
3. Check backend terminal - OTP will be printed like:
   ```
   [DEV MODE] OTP for 923746340@sfsu.edu: 123456
   ```
4. Copy OTP and paste into registration form

#### Option 2: Use Your Real Email (WORKS NOW)
- Register with `bavisettisaisaketh@gmail.com`
- You'll receive actual email with OTP
- Full end-to-end flow works

#### Option 3: Verify Domain (For Production)
- Go to https://resend.com/domains
- Verify a domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
- Update `SENDER_EMAIL` to use verified domain
- Then can send to ANY email address

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS (When You Return)

### Immediate Testing:
1. **Start backend** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd backend && ../venv/Scripts/python.exe main.py
   ```

2. **Test Registration Flow**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/professor/register
   - Fill in form with:
     - Name: Your name
     - Email: 923746340@sfsu.edu (or bavisettisaisaketh@gmail.com)
     - Department: Computer Science
   - Click "Send OTP"
   - **Check backend terminal for OTP** (it will print like: `[DEV MODE] OTP for X: 123456`)
   - Enter OTP in form
   - Create password
   - Complete registration
   - Try logging in!

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Email Improvements**:
   - Consider domain verification for production
   - Add "resend OTP" button cooldown
   - Email rate limiting

2. **Security**:
   - Add CAPTCHA to prevent OTP spam
   - Monitor failed verification attempts
   - Add account lockout after too many failures

3. **UX Improvements**:
   - Show "OTP sent" confirmation with timer
   - Auto-focus OTP input field
   - Clear instructions about checking spam folder
