## üÜò I'm Getting Errors

### "Model not found"
**‚Üí Read**: `TROUBLESHOOT_OLLAMA_ERRORS.md`

### "Connection refused"
**‚Üí Read**: `TROUBLESHOOT_OLLAMA_ERRORS.md`

### Still getting tangential responses
**‚Üí Read**: `FIX_HALLUCINATION_TANGENTS.md`

## üìä Quick Summary

### What Was Wrong

1. **Rate Limiting** (after 10 questions)
   - Was using Groq API (14 req/min limit)
   - Fixed: Switched to Ollama (unlimited)

2. **System Errors**
   - Ollama wasn't running
   - Fixed: Proper startup guides

3. **Tangential Hallucinations** (MAIN ISSUE)
   - Asked: "Who is the department chair?"
   - Got: "The CS department offers courses..."
   - Fixed: 7-layer anti-hallucination system

---

### What Was Done

**7 Protection Layers**:
1. ‚úÖ Upgraded to DeepSeek R1 8B (better reasoning)
2. ‚úÖ Temperature 0.0 (deterministic responses)
3. ‚úÖ Ultra-strict prompts (explicit examples)
4. ‚úÖ Question repetition (forces focus)
5. ‚úÖ Automatic relevance checking (detects tangents)
6. ‚úÖ Question-type validation (answer matches question)
7. ‚úÖ Mandatory citations ([Local]/[Web])

---

### What You Need to Do

**3 Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Pull model (one time, 2 minutes)
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b

# 2. Start Ollama (keep running)
ollama serve

# 3. Start backend (new terminal)
cd D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\backend
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

**5 Test Questions**:
1. "Who is the department chair for Computer Science?"
2. "When is the application deadline for Fall 2025?"
3. "What is the minimum GPA for CS graduate admissions?"
4. "What courses does the CS department offer?"
5. "Who is the dean of underwater basket weaving?"

**Success**:
- Each response is either exact answer with [Local]/[Web] citation
- OR honest "I don't have that information"
- NO tangential responses
- Hallucination rate: 0%

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
Q: "Who is the department chair?"
A: "The Computer Science department offers a wide range of courses
    including AI, databases, software engineering..."
```
**Problem**: Tangential - doesn't answer WHO!

---

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
Q: "Who is the department chair?"
A: "I don't have information about the current department chair
    [Local][Web]. Please contact the CS department at cs.sfsu.edu."
```
**Success**: Admits not knowing instead of providing tangential info!
