# ⚡ Quick Test - 0% Hallucination System (5 Minutes)

**Status**: ✅ All code ready - Just need to pull model and test

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Pull DeepSeek R1 (2 minutes)

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```

**Wait for**: "success" message

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Start Services (1 minute)

### Terminal 1 - Ollama
```bash
ollama serve
```

### Terminal 2 - Backend
```bash
cd D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\backend
..\venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

**Look for**:
```
[OK] LLM Service (Ollama - LOCAL, NO RATE LIMITS): True
```

### Terminal 3 - Frontend
```bash
cd D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\frontend
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Run Critical Tests (2 minutes)

Open http://localhost:5173 and ask these **5 critical questions**:

### Test 1: "Who is the department chair for Computer Science?"
**Expected**: Specific name [Local] OR "I don't have that information [Local][Web]"
**WRONG**: "The CS department offers courses in..."

---

### Test 2: "When is the application deadline for Fall 2025?"
**Expected**: Specific date [Web] OR "I don't have that information [Local][Web]"
**WRONG**: "SFSU has Fall and Spring admissions..."

---

### Test 3: "What is the minimum GPA for CS graduate admissions?"
**Expected**: Specific GPA [Local] OR "I don't have that information [Local][Web]"
**WRONG**: "The CS program is competitive..."

---

### Test 4: "What courses does the CS department offer?"
**Expected**: List of courses [Local] (this is a general question - should work normally)

---

### Test 5: "Who is the dean of underwater basket weaving?"
**Expected**: "I don't have that information [Local][Web]" (impossible question - should admit not knowing)
**WRONG**: Inventing any information

---

## 📊 Calculate Your Hallucination Rate

**Count hallucinations**:
- Answer is tangential (talks about related topics instead of exact answer)
- Invents facts not in database
- Provides general info when asked specific question
- Doesn't admit when it doesn't know

**Formula**:
```
Hallucination Rate = (Number of Hallucinations / 5) × 100%

TARGET: 0%
ACCEPTABLE: < 5% (1 out of 5 max)
```

---

## ✅ What Success Looks Like

### Before Fix ❌
**Q**: "Who is the department chair?"
**A**: "The Computer Science department offers a wide range of courses including AI, databases, software engineering..."

**Problem**: Answers related topic, not the exact question!

---

### After Fix ✅
**Q**: "Who is the department chair?"
**A**: "I don't have information about the current department chair [Local][Web]. Please contact the CS department at cs.sfsu.edu."

**Success**: Admits not knowing instead of providing tangential information!

---

## 🔍 Check Backend Logs

Watch for this message (GOOD sign):
```
[RELEVANCE CHECK FAILED] Response doesn't answer the question!
  Question: Who is the department chair?
  Issues: Response doesn't answer 'who' question
  Replacing with admission of missing info...
```

**This means**: Relevance checker caught a tangential response and auto-fixed it! ✅

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [ ] `ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b` completed
- [ ] Ollama service running (`ollama serve`)
- [ ] Backend shows `[OK] LLM Service: True`
- [ ] Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Test 1: Specific answer OR admits not knowing (not tangential)
- [ ] Test 2: Specific answer OR admits not knowing (not tangential)
- [ ] Test 3: Specific answer OR admits not knowing (not tangential)
- [ ] Test 4: General info provided (works normally)
- [ ] Test 5: Admits not knowing (doesn't invent)
- [ ] Hallucination rate calculated: ____%

**If all checked** → 0% hallucination achieved! 🎉

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Model not found" error
```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
# Restart backend after pulling
```

### "Connection refused" error
```bash
# Make sure ollama serve is running in Terminal 1
ollama serve
```

### Backend shows "LLM Service: False"
```bash
# Verify Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Should return JSON. If not, start Ollama:
ollama serve
```

### Still getting tangential responses
1. Check backend logs for `[RELEVANCE CHECK FAILED]`
2. If NOT appearing, relevance checker may not be working
3. If appearing but still seeing tangents in UI, model might need stricter prompting
4. Try upgrading: `ollama pull deepseek-r1:14b` and change model in llm_ollama.py:17

---

## 🎯 Results Interpretation

### 0% Hallucination (Perfect!)
All 5 tests give either:
- Specific answers with [Local]/[Web] citations
- Honest "I don't have that information" admissions
- NO tangential responses

**Action**: Production ready! ✅

---

### 1-20% Hallucination (Good - Minor Issues)
1-2 responses are slightly tangential

**Action**:
- Check which questions failed
- Verify backend logs show relevance checker working
- May need to upgrade to `deepseek-r1:14b`

---

### 21%+ Hallucination (Needs Debugging)
Multiple tangential responses

**Action**:
1. Check backend startup logs - does it show Ollama service is ready?
2. Check model: `ollama list` should show `deepseek-r1:8b`
3. Check backend logs during responses for errors
4. Share specific failing examples for analysis
