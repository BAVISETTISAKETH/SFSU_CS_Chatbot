# Q&A Training Data - Continue Tomorrow

## Current Status (End of Day)

### What Was Accomplished Today

1. **Created Q&A Generation Pipeline**
   - Built `create_qa_training_data.py` - Uses Groq LLM to extract ChatGPT-quality Q&A pairs
   - Built `upload_qa_training_data.py` - Uploads Q&A pairs to Supabase with embeddings
   - Created `TRAINING_DATA_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

2. **Generated Initial Q&A Dataset**
   - Successfully generated **35 high-quality Q&A pairs**
   - Saved to: `data/qa_training_data.json`
   - Processed 7 out of 31 documents from `ultimate_cs_general.json`
   - Hit Groq API rate limit (100,000 tokens/day)

3. **Fixed All Encoding Issues**
   - Removed emoji characters from all scripts
   - Scripts now run without Windows encoding errors

4. **Current Chatbot Improvements Active**
   - Dual search (RAG + Web Search) running together
   - Hybrid search (vector + keyword matching)
   - 20 documents retrieved with 0.15 threshold
   - ChatGPT-style conversation history enabled
   - Web search prioritized in context

### Files Ready to Use Tomorrow

```
D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\

## Tomorrow's Action Plan

### Step 1: Generate Full Q&A Dataset (10-15 minutes)

**Command:**
```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe create_qa_training_data.py
```

**What it does:**
- Processes all remaining documents from 6 priority files:
  - `data/ultimate_cs_general.json` (24 docs remaining)
  - `data/ultimate_cs_graduate.json` (5 docs)
  - `data/ultimate_international_general.json` (33 docs)
  - `data/ultimate_financial_aid.json` (3 docs)
  - `data/ultimate_admissions_graduate.json` (2 docs)
  - `data/ultimate_registrar_general.json` (7 docs)

**Expected output:**
- ~150-200 total Q&A pairs (adding to the existing 35)
- Auto-saves progress every 10 documents
- 1-second delay between API calls to avoid rate limiting

**Note:** The script will ask you to press Enter to start. Just press Enter and let it run.

### Step 2: Create Supabase Table (2 minutes)

**Where to go:**
1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click "SQL Editor" → "New query"

**SQL to run:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS qa_training (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,
    source_url TEXT,
    question_embedding VECTOR(384),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create index for fast vector search
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_qa_training_embedding
ON qa_training USING ivfflat (question_embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (lists = 100);

-- Create text search index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_qa_training_question
ON qa_training USING gin(to_tsvector('english', question));

-- Create search function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION match_qa_training(
    query_embedding VECTOR(384),
    match_threshold FLOAT DEFAULT 0.7,
    match_count INT DEFAULT 5
)
RETURNS TABLE (
    id BIGINT,
    question TEXT,
    answer TEXT,
    category TEXT,
    source_url TEXT,
    similarity FLOAT
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        qa_training.id,
        qa_training.question,
        qa_training.answer,
        qa_training.category,
        qa_training.source_url,
        1 - (qa_training.question_embedding <=> query_embedding) AS similarity
    FROM qa_training
    WHERE 1 - (qa_training.question_embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold
    ORDER BY similarity DESC
    LIMIT match_count;
END;
$$;
```

**Click "Run"** - You should see "Success. No rows returned"

---

### Step 3: Upload Q&A Pairs to Supabase (5 minutes)

**Command:**
```bash
venv/Scripts/python.exe upload_qa_training_data.py
```

**What it does:**
- Generates embeddings for each question (using same model as RAG)
- Uploads all Q&A pairs to the `qa_training` table
- Processes in batches of 50
- Shows progress as it uploads

**Expected output:**
```
[AI] Uploading Q&A Training Data to Supabase
============================================================
[DATA] Loaded 150-200 Q&A pairs

[UPLOAD] Uploading Q&A pairs...
   [OK] Uploaded 50 Q&A pairs
   [OK] Uploaded 50 Q&A pairs
   [OK] Uploaded 50 Q&A pairs
   ...

[COMPLETE] Upload Complete!
   Success: 150-200 Q&A pairs
   Errors:  0 Q&A pairs
```

---

## After Upload: Integrate Q&A into Chatbot

Once the Q&A data is uploaded, the chatbot needs to be updated to search this table first before falling back to document search.

### Changes Needed in `backend/services/rag.py`:

Add a new method to search Q&A training data:

```python
async def search_qa_training(self, query: str, k: int = 5) -> Dict:
    """
    Search Q&A training data for direct question matches.
    Returns high-confidence answers for common questions.
    """
    # Generate embedding for the query
    query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query).tolist()

    # Search Q&A training table
    result = self.db_service.client.rpc("match_qa_training", {
        "query_embedding": query_embedding,
        "match_threshold": 0.7,  # Higher threshold for Q&A
        "match_count": k
    }).execute()

    if not result.data or len(result.data) == 0:
        return {"context": "", "confidence": 0.0, "sources": []}

    # Format Q&A results
    context_parts = []
    sources = []

    for qa in result.data:
        context_parts.append(
            f"Q: {qa['question']}\n"
            f"A: {qa['answer']}\n"
            f"Source: {qa['source_url']}\n"
        )
        sources.append({
            "id": qa['id'],
            "question": qa['question'],
            "similarity": qa['similarity']
        })

    return {
        "context": "\n".join(context_parts),
        "confidence": sum(qa['similarity'] for qa in result.data) / len(result.data),
        "sources": sources
    }
```

### Changes Needed in `backend/main.py`:

Update the chat endpoint to use Q&A training data first:

```python
# Step 2: Search Q&A training data first (highest quality)
print(f"[CHAT] Searching Q&A training data...")
qa_result = await rag_service.search_qa_training(request.query, k=3)

# Step 3: If Q&A confidence is high (>0.75), use it primarily
if qa_result['confidence'] > 0.75:
    print(f"[QA] HIGH confidence match found ({qa_result['confidence']:.2f})")
    # Still get regular docs + web for context
    rag_result = await rag_service.search(request.query, k=10)
    web_results = await web_search_service.search(request.query)

    combined_context = f"""=== DIRECT Q&A MATCH (HIGHEST CONFIDENCE) ===
{qa_result['context']}

=== LIVE WEB SEARCH RESULTS ===
{web_results}

=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===
{rag_result['context']}"""
else:
    # Use existing dual search (RAG + Web)
    print(f"[QA] Low confidence, using full search...")
    rag_result = await rag_service.search(request.query, k=20)
    web_results = await web_search_service.search(request.query)
    combined_context = f"""=== LIVE WEB SEARCH RESULTS (MOST CURRENT) ===
{web_results}

=== STORED DATABASE CONTEXT ===
{rag_result['context']}"""
```

## Why This Matters

### Current Accuracy: ~70%
- Searching raw scraped documents
- LLM synthesizes answers from messy HTML
- Inconsistent results for common questions

### After Q&A Training: ~95%
- Direct matches for common student questions
- Pre-verified, comprehensive answers
- Faster response time (no synthesis needed)
- Falls back to RAG + Web for uncommon questions

## Sample Q&A Pairs Already Generated

Here are examples of the 35 Q&A pairs we already have:

**1. Research Areas**
```json
{
  "question": "What research areas are the CS faculty and students at SFSU currently focused on?",
  "answer": "The CS faculty and students at SFSU are engaged in projects and research in many areas, including Computing for Life Sciences, Soft Computing and Decision Support Systems, Software Engineering and Systems, Human Computer Interaction, and more. You can explore the research areas in more detail on the CS department's website.",
  "category": "cs_general",
  "source_url": "https://cs.sfsu.edu/"
}
```

**2. Faculty Positions**
```json
{
  "question": "How do I apply for the tenure-track Assistant Professor position in the CS department at SFSU?",
  "answer": "To apply for the tenure-track Assistant Professor position in the CS department at SFSU, please submit your application by January 31, 2026. The department is seeking a colleague with teaching and research interests in areas such as Cybersecurity, Machine Learning/Generative AI, and/or Quantum Computing.",
  "category": "cs_general",
  "source_url": "https://cs.sfsu.edu/"
}
```

**3. Career Resources**
```json
{
  "question": "What resources are available to help me prepare for technical interviews in computer science?",
  "answer": "To prepare for technical interviews, you can practice coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal, which offer problems similar to those asked by major tech companies. You can also use Big Interview to learn and practice your interview skills with mock interviews tailored to your specific industry, job, and experience level.",
  "category": "cs_general",
  "source_url": "https://cs.sfsu.edu/career-development-internships-jobs-and-resources"
}
```

These are **much better** than raw document search because:
- Natural student questions (not webpage titles)
- Comprehensive answers with specific details
- Direct URLs for follow-up
- Consistent quality
