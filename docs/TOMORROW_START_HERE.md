# 🚀 START HERE TOMORROW

## ⚡ Quick Resume (30 seconds):

### Step 1: Check Scraper Status
```bash
# Check if scraper completed
ls -lh data/sfsu_ultimate_crawl.json

# If file is 10+ MB, scraper completed successfully!
```

### Step 2: Check What's Still Running
```bash
# Frontend should be at: http://localhost:5173
# Backend should be at: http://localhost:8000

# If they're not running, restart them:
```

### Step 3: Restart Servers (if needed)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend:
cd D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot
venv\Scripts\activate
cd backend
python main.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend:
cd D:\sfsu-cs-chatbot\frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 YOUR MAIN TASK TOMORROW:

### **Migrate the scraped data and test Alli!**

```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Run the final migration
python migrate_final.py

# This will add ~1500-2000 new documents to your database!
# Takes about 10-15 minutes
```

### **Then test Alli:**

Open http://localhost:5173 and ask:

1. ✅ **"What is CPT for international students?"**
   - Should give accurate info about Curricular Practical Training

2. ✅ **"Tell me about financial aid at SFSU"**
   - Should describe grants, scholarships, FAFSA

3. ✅ **"What CS courses are available?"**
   - Should list actual CS courses with codes

4. ✅ **"How do I apply for graduate programs?"**
   - Should give application requirements and process

5. ✅ **"Tell me about housing options at SFSU"**
   - Should describe on-campus housing

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### If Frontend Won't Load:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Then visit: http://localhost:5173
```

### If Backend Won't Start:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
cd backend
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python main.py
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

### If Migration Fails:
```bash
# Check your .env file has:
SUPABASE_URL=https://....supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJ...

# Then try again:
python migrate_final.py
```

### If Alli Gives Bad Answers:
1. Check if migration completed (adds new data)
2. Restart backend (clears caches)
3. Review prompts in `backend/services/llm.py`

2. **Run migration FIRST** - This loads all new SFSU data
3. **Then test thoroughly** - Ask diverse questions
4. **Everything is documented** - Check `STATUS_CURRENT_SESSION.md` for details
